Текст новости: “Talent only gets you so far,” Booker told FOX Sports. “I’ve been on teams with less talent that found ways to get more wins. It’s just the little things. What people always say, the details of the game. Although it sounds like we should know that at this part of our careers, it’s just something you need to form and develop and learn through trial and error.

Текст новости: When asked if he believes he could be traded too, he pointed to the fact that no one is safe, something that was driven home to everyone in the NBA when the Dallas Mavericks sent Luka Doncic – a 26-year-old who is considered a top-three player in the league – to the Los Angeles Lakers in February. “Look at the situation that got Luka here,” Booker told FOX Sports. “I understand that it’s a business. I’ve been around a long time. The Luka one is probably the craziest trade we’ve seen. But the game just keeps going.”

Social media, they can do what they want. When you’re getting claimed that by two Hall of Famers, [including] one, [who’s] arguably the best player to ever live, it means a lot. I developed a good relationship with all those guys through the summer at the Olympics. The respect is real. I can feel it when they talk to me.”

Phoenix remains in 10th in the West for the final play-in spot in the conference as Dallas (34-37) topped Detroit, 123-117, at home. Dallas has the same record as Phoenix, but the Suns hold the tiebreaker over the Mavs Phoenix (34-37) was without Nick Richards (right calf tightness), who was a late scratch, Bradley Beal (hamstring), Grayson Allen (foot), Mason Plumlee (quad) and Vasa Micic (illness).

Текст новости: Currently, the LA Lakers have three players on two-way contracts: Jordan Goodwin, Trey Jemison III, and Christian Koloko. However, according to Jovan Buha of The Athletic, only two of them are expected to be converted to standard NBA deals. To make room, Cam Reddish and Alex Len are likely to be waived, while no other main roster players are expected to be cut. “There’s a chance [of all three two-way guys being converted], but realistically, it’s probably not gonna happen just because I think that the only two obvious players to cut on the roster are Cam Reddish and Alex Len,” Buha noted on his latest podcast. “Shake Milton has two more years of a non-guaranteed contract, which could be a valuable trade ship. Markieff Morris is a beloved figure in the locker room. He’s an internal leader; Luka loves him, and LeBron loves him,” Buha went on to say.

Текст новости: Coach Chris Finch did something a little different to change the energy of the team from the start. He started Joe Ingles, whose autistic son Jacob is now able to attend games in an arena for the first time in his life. Ingles’ family has been living in Orlando this season, and they were here this week, but Ingles hadn’t played. Finch gave Ingles the start, with Ingles’ former teammate in Utah Mike Conley ceding his spot. “It was emotional,” Finch said. “Sometimes you gotta do the human thing. We always talk about all these minutes matter, and those minutes matter for another reason.”

Текст новости: “So Chris, how did the conversation go with Joe when you brought it to him?” Chris Finch: “You know, he was really appreciative—emotional. And you know, obviously I had to have a conversation with Mike too, who was super pumped. And everyone in the organization was really excited for that, and for their family, and for Jacob in particular. But yeah, you know, Joe’s meant so much to us this season. I can’t begin to thank him for his leadership. In a team such as ours and the way we’re constructed, we brought him here with a different vision, and that hasn’t worked out just simply because we’ve got so much depth after the trade. We’re just trying to get all these guys into a rhythm and connectivity and stuff. And he’s been always ready. But his voice in the locker room, and his presence, and his personality on this team, and his leadership has meant everything—particularly for our young guys. So, you know, it’s the least we could do.”

It’s something I’ll never forget.”

For him to work so hard and now be out there with his brother and sister and his mom and all sit there and watch his dad—it’s just super cool. Especially with my daughter coming along, our youngest, to enjoy things with his brother and sister. I think a lot of people, especially with kids, think you miss out on stuff. It’s not just about buses, aquariums, schools, or cars—it’s not like, ‘Oh, you’re in the NBA, you’ve got money, those problems go away.’ They don’t. It’s a reality for us every day.

There were so many times my wife was alone with him, laying on the floor in public. You can feel people staring, judging, making comments—but they don’t know what he’s going through. Since he got diagnosed, we’ve tried to raise awareness. It doesn’t matter who you are—your lifestyle or your money. Jacob doesn’t care that I play basketball. He just wants his dad home.

Текст новости: On Friday the Warriors announced Curry would be re-evaluated Monday after an MRI revealed the superstar point guard suffered a pelvic contusion, but not structural damage, which is a good sign according to Stanford Medicine’s Dr. Todd Alamin. “So that’s really good news,” Dr. Alamin told NBC Sports Bay Area regarding Curry’s MRI results. “He landed directly on his tailbone, and the worry is that he might have a more significant injury to his tailbone such as a fracture or a dislocation of one of the joints within it. The fact that he had a contusion, which is basically a little bit of bleeding between the back of the bony part of the tailbone and the skin overlying it. It’s a really good bit of news because it tells us it’s more of a soft-tissue injury than a bone injury.

Текст новости: In an appearance on WEEI Friday morning, team governor Wyc Grousbeck tried to downplay the possibility that the team would be looking to exit the Garden. “That’s probably not something I’m even going to get into today, but I will say this: we have a long-term partnership and friendship going back with the Jacobs now 22 years,” Grousbeck said on the Greg Hill Show Friday. “It’s been really quite something, and we’ve risen this team to close to the top of the league, like in the top three or four of the whole league, in terms of revenues, based on that lease and that building, because of our fans and because of our team.”

Текст новости: During that time, Grousbeck is expected to collaborate with Chisholm and his group as the team navigates through a massive offseason with a skyrocketing payroll and luxury tax penalties. How will the team handle a payroll that is currently projected to land north of $233 million with nearly $300 million in luxury tax penalities? Grousbeck shed some light on the upcoming situation during an interview on Friday morning with the Greg Hill Show on WEEI. “Let me put a pin in that balloon too,” Grousbeck said when asked about the challenges of staying in the luxury tax. “It’s not the luxury tax bill, it’s the basketball penalties. The new CBA was designed by the league to stop teams from going crazy. They decided that it’s not good enough to go after the wallets because the fans can be like, ‘Hey find someone who can afford to spend $500 million dollars a year or whatever it is, like the English Premiere League. I know seven guys who own premiere league teams in England with no spending caps and most of them don’t know what the hell is going on.”

Текст новости: “The basketball penalties mean that it’s even more of a premium now to have your basketball general manager be brilliant and lucky,” Grousbeck said. “Because you have to navigate because you can’t stay in the second-apron, nobody will, I predict, for the next 40 years of the CBA, no one is going to stay in the second apron more than two years.”

He’s looking at this and is going to extend our window and make it work. We’ll find out in June or July what we’re going to do.”

Текст новости: Well, it’s just—so you have these two guys. Wyc’s dad puts up the most money for the team. Wyc’s the one that’s organizing the group, and it starts out, I think, with four people that put up the money. They get the price, and then their job after they get the price is to go find a group of minority people to offload some of the money they just committed to. Which, by the way, that’s what Chisholm’s doing right now. He’s already put the feelers out, trying to put together a little syndicate to offload some of the money that he’s already promised. So that’s in motion now. So they get the four. But Pags was always—it was like, Wyc’s the owner, and the dad put up the most money, but also here’s Pags. And they’ve had this uneasy co-owner alliance. Wyc was always the face of it, and it was always a little awkward. You could feel it when they were holding the trophy. You know—that’s when Lasry and Edens had that too. Some of these co-owner—like Guber and Leo, same thing—where it’s like: it’s my team, but you have to be here, and let’s hold the trophy together. And it’s always super awkward.

He was not given a heads-up.”

Текст новости: But this is why it’s so amazing when somebody buys a team like the Celtics. You go from: I could walk by you and have no idea who you are—to now, you’re one of the kings of Boston. And I think that’s—I think Wyc’s had a really hard time with that over the last year. Knowing that there’s some endgame where, when you’re the owner of the Celtics, the room treats you a little differently than when you’re not. And I think he’s aware of that, which leads into this idea that he’s going to be the governor of this team for the next three years—which I believe is going to be the case. Because I believe it’s going to be codified in the sale agreement.

Текст новости: NBA Communications: NBA ANNOUNCES PENALTIES FROM NETS-PACERS GAME NEW YORK, March 21, 2025 – Brooklyn Nets guard-forward Trendon Watford and Indiana Pacers center-forward Myles Turner have each been fined $35,000 for their involvement in an on-court altercation, it was announced today by Joe Dumars, Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations. In addition, Pacers guard-forward Andrew Nembhard was fined $20,000 for his role in initiating the altercation. The altercation was initiated by Nembhard and Watford and escalated when Watford delivered a right forearm to the chest region of Nembhard. Following that action, Turner escalated the altercation further by shoving Watford. The incident, for which Watford was assessed two technical fouls and ejected, occurred with 4:48 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Pacers’ 105-99 overtime victory over the Nets on March 20 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Turner and Nembhard were each assessed technical fouls for their roles in the incident.

So he’s gonna do what he does and take on a matchup every night, but it’s good to have him around.”

Текст новости: Pagliuca was one of four finalists in the bidding process, but his bid was not selected. His statement reads as follows: “Since the Grousbeck family announced it would sell the Boston Celtics almost nine months ago,” Pagliuca wrote. “I have worked tirelessly to put together a strong bid centered around the great majority of existing owners of the team who understand and appreciate what it means to be a steward of the Boston Celtics, a team steeped in championship tradition.” “Additionally, I recruited new partners with deep resources and expertise in technology and international markets to maximize the Celtics’ successes to ensure we can always compete for championships, luxury taxes be damned.” “We made a fully guaranteed and financed offer at a record price, befitting the best sports fans int he world and with all the capital coming from individuals who ae committed to winning on and off the court. We had no debt or private equity money that would potentially hamstring our ability to compete in the future. We have felt it was the best offer for the Celtics. It is a bid of true fans, deeply connected to Boston’s community, and we’ve been saddened to find out we have not been selected in the process.”

And by the way — if he played that physical all the time, he’d be much more respected around the NBA than he is. He’s respected as a talented player, but — you saw Matt Barnes say the other day — Matt said, ‘Cat’s problem is he a cat. He not a dog.’ That’s what Matt said.” “If KAT came out and played with the type of dog he played with against me the other night? Man — good luck guarding Karl-Anthony Towns. Good luck. Because the way he shoots the ball like a guard, and he’s got that type of dog — you’re not stopping him.”

And I’ve actually played against Karl before where some things were said, or you hear this, that, and the other, and he didn’t come out and act like he knew what was going on. And I hate that.” “I love the way he came out. First play, they give him the ball. He gets me on the pump fake. Guess why he got me on that pump fake? Because I’m thinking the same thing he’s thinking — ‘It’s me and you right now. What’s up?’ He shoots the pump fake. I want it so bad — ah, I go for the pump fake. He drives. Bro, I’m like, ‘Hey, guess what? Guess what?’ I’m like, ‘Okay, here we go. It’s time. Let’s go at it.’ And so I love that. I applaud him for the mentality he came out with.”

Now, vice versa, I get the first block on Giannis, Karl gets the dunk — you’re feeling a little different. Now he’s feeling good about himself, right? He gets a couple open threes, you know, in the flow of the offense, he’s making shots — it’s good. So I need to put this fire out. So now, at that point as a defender, I have to do whatever I need to do to put this fire out.”

Текст новости: After just one 20-point game in his first 18 with Milwaukee, Kuzma has scored 20 points in back-to-back games, helping lead the team to a win that the Bucks desperately needed after losing five of their previous seven games. “He’s just more comfortable,” Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. “You can see it, it’s coming. A lot of it was organically tonight. I think we ran one play for him the entire game, he still had 20 points. That’s the value of him.”

Текст новости: In the six games between the second ankle sprain and the start of this road trip, Kuzma averaged only 9.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 0.8 assists per game on 36.5 percent shooting from the field and 21.7 percent from 3. “I’m an unselfish player,” Kuzma said, following a 14-point outing in the Bucks’ 112-100 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 9. “I try to make the right reads and the right passes. I definitely feel that I could be a little bit more aggressive or being a little bit more of an initiator. I think I’ve been getting live reps at that for the past two years with no. 1 defenders guarding me every night. “Sometimes I find myself a little bit in the corner, which is naturally going to happen and a lot of times with my role or my placement is on this team, which is fine, but there’s a lot of times, I think we can find ways to get me more active. I think that’s something that we talk about anyways, as a team, for sure.”

Текст новости: Following Tuesday’s game in San Francisco, however, Lillard made it clear that Kuzma should not be living off a heavy diet of catch-and-shoot 3s. Instead, the Bucks should be finding ways for him to play to his strengths. “We gotta find ways to put him in position to do what he does well,” Lillard said. “He is an attacker downhill, gets in the paint. He’s a good playmaker when he’s doing that. It’s hard to do that when we’re taking the ball out the net because he’s a guy we want to advance the ball to and let him attack downhill. “You want to give him those opportunities to be that guy and be a playmaker. And we just, we gotta be better about that. I think tonight he hit some 3s, but he’s not a guy that we want to use him, like, just a spot-up shooter. Even though he can make shots, that’s not what we want to put him in a position to be doing.”

Текст новости: It’s confounding that the Suns are in this position considering they have a coach with championship experience in Budenholzer, a two-time champion and two-time Finals MVP in Durant and seven All-Star appearances between Booker (four) and Beal (three). So, seriously, what’s the problem? “Talent only gets you so far,” Devin Booker told FOX Sports. “I’ve been on teams with less talent that found ways to get more wins. It’s just the little things. What people always say, the details of the game. Although it sounds like we should know that at this part of our careers, it’s just something you need to form and develop and learn through trial and error.

Текст новости: This past summer, Steve Kerr called Booker the “unsung MVP” of Team USA following its gold medal-winning run at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Booker started every contest and finished with a plus-minus rating of +130 over 11 games, the highest of anyone on the team. Back in 2021, LeBron James, unprompted, expressed a similar sentiment about Booker, tweeting that he was “the most disrespected player in our league” after he was snubbed for the All-Star Game. (He was later named to the team by NBA commissioner Adam Silver as an injury replacement for Anthony Davis.) When Booker was asked if he gets the respect he deserves, he shrugged. “From the people that I respect,” Booker told FOX Sports. “I wouldn’t want it any other way. Social media, they can do what they want. When you’re getting claimed that by two Hall of Famers, [including] one, [who’s] arguably the best player to ever live, it means a lot. I developed a good relationship with all those guys through the summer at the Olympics. The respect is real. I can feel it when they talk to me.”

Текст новости: Booker often thinks about how the Suns climbed out of the cellar four years ago, something he was recently reminded of as he stood in that locker room in Los Angeles. He’s choosing to believe they can do that again. “We were at the bottom of the league,” Booker told FOX Sports. “So, it’s something that I’ve seen can turn around. I’ve seen it be fixed before. So, that’s the motivation. Just do that again.”

Текст новости: That’s what makes performances like the one the Hornets turned in Thursday night against the New York Knicks noteworthy. All they can do is play spoiler, making life miserable for opponents who assume the Eastern Conference’s second-worst team (record-wise) has packed it in and is merely going through the proverbial motions while awaiting the season’s conclusion. “It just gives us confidence,” Miles Bridges told The Observer after the Hornets’ thorough 115-98 victory over the Knicks. “It gives us confidence knowing we can play how we want to when we are semi-healthy. Just imagine when we are fully healthy. “As long as we keep building good habits, building winning habits, I think we’ll be good for next year.”

Wandering minds, albeit even for a brief second, haven’t been much of a problem lately. “We’ve definitely been focusing on possession by possession,” Bridges said, “on offense trying to find a mismatch, on defense talking more, and just focusing on the details.”

Текст новости: When the NBA bounces later this year from Warner Bros. Discovery’s TNT cable network to NBCUniversal’s NBC and Peacock and Amazon’s Prime Video, the league will spark perhaps the biggest transfer of audience and advertising dollars in the history of the medium since CBS lost a decades-old contract with the NFL to Fox in 1993. Viewership shifts caused by that move, including the loss of affiliates, still pressure CBS today. Warner could be in similar straits: The company is projected to lose $1.1 billion in TV advertising in 2026, approximately 23% of its total this year, according to Robert Fishman, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, due in significant part to the absence of the NBA on its networks for the first time since 1989.

Disney, which is staying in business with the NBA even as it sheds some of the games it previously showed, is seen capturing $1.25 billion in annual ad revenue from NBA games, according to Fishman, thanks to its hold over the NBA Finals. NBC could take in $1 billion or more, the analyst has projected, while Amazon might win $750 million. In all, there will be 75 NBA games shown across broadcast TV under the new deal, compared with 15 in the most recent media agreement.

These executives said Amazon hasn’t taken the pugnacious stance it did when it first tried to line up ad support for “Thursday Night Football.” At the time, the company pushed potential sponsors to match the prices they were paying for highly rated Sunday-afternoon games on Fox. The tone, so far at least, is “aggressive, not egregious,” says one buyer.

Текст новости: Mayers Leonard: I knew after the Milwaukee season that I couldn’t play basketball anymore. It was the hardest decision I never had to make—because my body made it for me. At first, I wasn’t planning to say anything. I figured people would assume as time passed. But what I’ve come to realize is that while my body told me to hang it up, my heart wasn’t ready. Learning to sing and songwrite has given me a chance to reflect on everything basketball has given me—and how every goodbye has led to something good. Leaving my small hometown to play for the University of Illinois led to meeting the love of my life. Leaving college early for the NBA gave me the opportunity to take care of my entire family. Leaving Portland for Miami gave me the chance to compete in the Finals and play the best basketball of my career. And now, leaving the NBA has given me the greatest blessing of all—the chance to be the father I never had, to fall asleep next to my beautiful wife every night, and to spend time with the most important people in my life. This song is a thank you—to basketball, the fans, my teammates, my family, the organizations, and everyone who believed in a young kid from Robinson, Illinois.

Nebraska native John Cooper purchased the nine-bedroom, 19-bathroom mansion in December—paying just over half of the most recent $14.89 million asking price for the dwelling, which had been on the market for 13 years. Initially, he vowed to protect the Chicago-area home’s enduring legacy—although he noted that he had some “exciting plans” for the future of the home.

Текст новости: “I don’t know how much of a worry it was at like the top level of the organization, in terms of the Jeanie-Rob level, but I know in talking to lower level people there in the immediate aftermath of the trade and the situation, there was a sense,” Jovan Buha of The Athletic said on his podcast. “There’s no way LeBron knew [about the trade]. And doing a trade of this magnitude and not giving him the heads up… He’s always been ‘the guy’ since he entered the league,” Buha went on to say. “It’s not that teams have run every decision by him, but something this big — trading AD and essentially reshaping the franchise — you’d expect him to get heads up. “Given his contract situation and Klutch [Sports] potentially losing influence with AD’s departure, some thought it could potentially lead to him asking out or at least exploring that option. Obviously, that did not happen.”

Текст новости: With young All-Stars surrounded by high-level depth, the Celtics should be talented enough to continue competing for championships for years to come. But the financial reality could dictate making big changes to the team’s core. Either that or ownership will need to stomach the largest payroll in the history of the NBA. According to The Athletic’s John Hollinger, the Celtics could be paying in the area of $445 million in salary and tax next season, without Horford and Luke Kornet, both free agents and key frontcourt players.

While driving in the paint with 3:32 left in the third quarter, Curry went up in the air and collided with two Raptors players while passing the ball to Jonathan Kuminga for a corner 3-point attempt. Curry fell hard to the court on his back. He remained on the floor in pain while training staff looked after him. He gingerly walked off the court under his own power, sitting down on the Warriors’ bench before eventually leaving for the locker room.

Текст новости: Last week, before the Wolves won in Denver, a local reporter asked Finch about his time with Nikola Jokic as a Nuggets assistant coach during the 2016-17 season. Finch responded that he could see the potential in a young Jokic and his passing ability, but also how he worked away from games. “I just remember how good like every day behind closed doors Nikola was,” Finch said. “It was incredible to watch him every day. I would say to anybody: This guy is going to be the best passing big man ever to play the game.” Jokic was 22 at the time Finch was in Denver, Edwards is 23. So I asked Finch what he might see in Edwards at such a young age that could propel him to a perennial MVP-level candidate. “Ant has it within him to be an MVP-caliber player, no doubt about it,” Finch said. “His path to that, I’ve always thought, is going to be as one of the best two-way players in the league. We’ve seen him this year just kind of evolve more and more with a ball in his hands as a primary playmaker. That’s certainly going to keep growing. … “He’s got a lot of areas he’s going to continue to get better, and being able to fine-tune his closing in games is also going to be an indicator of his ability.”

Текст новости: Now that the Celtics have been sold to Bill Chisholm for a record $6.1B, pending approval of the NBA’s Board of Governors, the league is expected to begin exploring expansion in earnest, sources told SBJ.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: The number Chisolm reportedly paid for the Celtics — which one team executive today called a “great price” — could appease the owners who were initially lukewarm on expansion. Not only would the $6.1B sale be the highest for a franchise in North American Sports history (by far eclipsing the NBA-record $4B paid by Mat Ishbia for the Suns), but executives leaguewide had never believed current owner Wyc Grousbeck would never receive a figure that exorbitant.

Текст новости: Jeff Teague: When I left, every time Minnesota lost, I went out and had a great time. That [] messed the game up, though. Analytics eliminated a lot of positions. Players who were good basketball players got pushed out. Look at guys like Jahlil Okafor—he could’ve still contributed, but because he didn’t shoot, it was like, ‘[] it.’ Analytics murdered people’s games. I mean, analytics didn’t fully take me out—my knees did that—but it made the game weird. Chris Paul is one of the best mid-range point guards ever, and when OKC let him just be Chris Paul again, they won 12 to 15 more games. Analytics didn’t account for that.

Текст новости: While insiders typically work for established media companies like ESPN, where they benefit from substantial resources and access to big audiences, Jake Fischer’s position stands out. He operates out of his Brooklyn apartment and publishes scoops behind a paywall on Substack. It’s not even his own Substack. He contributes to The Stein Line, which was launched in 2021 by veteran reporter Marc Stein, who has covered the NBA for over 30 years at outlets including ESPN and The New York Times. The Stein Line currently ranks as the fifth most-popular sports newsletter on Substack, with over 40,000 subscribers. (Stein wouldn’t disclose how many are paid subscribers, but Substack’s leaderboard reveals it’s in the thousands.)

Текст новости: Soon after, Stein reached out to see if they could work together. “I was very intrigued by it because of the entrepreneurial aspect of being your own boss,” Fischer said. Insider reporting can be a ruthless, zero-sum game. There are only so many scoops to go around, and journalists can be extremely protective of their sources. That makes Stein and Fischer an interesting team. Fischer refers to Stein as his “work dad” and keeps his contact info pinned to the top of the Messages app on his computer. They share intel and co-byline stories. As Stein says, “We have access to more sources who can help with confirmations if we join forces on a given story.”

Текст новости: Unlike Wojnarowski, who worked as a beat reporter at local newspapers before becoming an award-winning columnist, and Charania, who started trying to be an insider while still in high school, Fischer began his career hoping to write longform magazine features. “I never wanted to be an insider,” he said. Fischer scored an internship at Sports Illustrated in 2015 and stacked his portfolio with human interest articles. He got coffee with an NBA coach obsessed with Starbucks. He chronicled the rigorous routines that two over-40 players went through to stay on the court near the end of their careers. “I made all these relationships around the NBA by writing these non-threatening stories,” he said.

Текст новости: A few years ago, an agent vowed that his entire agency would never talk to Fischer again after the young reporter relayed bad information. This year, though, that agent called Fischer more than anyone else in the week leading up to the deadline, asking what he’d heard about one client, who ended up getting traded. “I feel like if you treat people well, they always come back,” Fischer said. That mentality may be why he’s managed to carve out a unique role for himself in a constantly evolving sports media landscape. In addition to writing for The Stein Line, Fischer also produces freelance NBA video content for Bleacher Report.

Текст новости: Following a years-long FBI investigation, federal authorities have accused Henley of kidnapping and fatally shooting a young rapper in the face and leaving his body in the Las Vegas desert over perceived disrespect and directing the robbery of an unlicensed L.A. marijuana dispensary that had stopped making extortion payments. Henley also allegedly defrauded companies, donors, athletes and celebrities — including NBA star Draymond Green and Lakers legend Shaquille O’Neal — persuading them to donate to his charities and later allegedly transferring the money to his personal bank accounts.

Henley allegedly embezzled the entire donation, transferring the funds to his personal checking account. Another was O’Neal, who wrote a $20,000 check intended to support Developing Options and the Crenshaw Rams youth sports team. Henley allegedly transferred most of the money to his bank account.

Текст новости: The Boston Celtics have agreed to be sold to private equity investor Bill Chisholm for an initial $6.1 billion, with the the final valuation to reach $7.3 billion, Axios has learned from sources familiar with the situation. Why it matters: This is the most ever paid for a professional sports team, topping the $6 billion that Josh Harris paid in 2023 for the NFL’s Washington Commanders. It’s made even more remarkable because the Celtics don’t own their own arena and have one of the league’s highest payrolls. Zoom in: The deal is split into two parts. The initial purchase this summer of a majority stake is at the $6.1 billion valuation, but the rest is expected to be valued at a whopping $7.3 billion.

Текст новости: Mavericks fans, who watched Dirk Nowitzki play his entire hall-of-fame career in Dallas, believed they had landed another one-franchise legend who would lead them to a title––and who could blame them? “The ending of the book was open-ended, but it was upbeat,” MacMahon said. “They had just gone to the Finals, and [Dončić] said he’s ecstatic to be in Dallas.”

Текст новости: But all of that––including MacMahon’s book––was upended just after midnight on February 2, when ESPN’s resident NBA scoop-hound Shams Charania broke the news that the Mavericks were trading Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for star big man Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a future first-round draft pick. MacMahon, like pretty much everyone else, was flabbergasted by the trade. But his shock quickly gave way to urgency. “I was like, Oh yeah, we need to add another chapter,” MacMahon said.

When The Wonder Boy hits shelves next week, customers who purchase one of the first 8,000 copies will have to download the final chapter. MacMahon is bummed that it won’t be in every edition of the book, but the bombshell development allowed him to tell the entire story of Dončić’s tenure with the Mavericks. He just didn’t expect it to end so soon. “You have the most precious commodity in the NBA––stability with a superstar––and they decided to move on from that,” MacMahon said in disbelief.

Текст новости: Below are all four of his blocked shots. Each shows the many ways Draymond Green can completely disrupt an offense. “He’s the best defender I’ve ever seen,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I mean, you see the pick-and-roll with Dame. If he’s in it, he kind of does this fake blitz thing with his speed, with his anticipation. He forces Dame back out towards halfcourt and he’s able to get back. The speed and recovery with Draymond is just stunning. “And then the brain that goes with it. If he’s on the weak side, he’s constantly coming over to help. He’s one of the great defenders of all time, and he’s still doing it at a high level.”

Playing 17 games alongside his fellow 35-year-old has given him an enhanced sense of appreciation for Green. “Hell yeah,” Butler said. “I think you have to respect the hell out of what he does, and it’s so hard to do. To shoot the ball, I don’t know, four times maybe, if that, and then just lock in on defense every possession down and get mad when anybody scores — not just the guy he’s guarding — you don’t find that around the league too often. “He has won at this level. He is a Hall of Famer for a reason. I just respect what he brings to this squad, what he brings to this locker room and how he affects winning in every single way.”

Текст новости: The stats Tuesday night did Green justice. Often times they don’t tell the full story, particularly on defense, requiring watching the game to actually make it clear why Green deserves so much applause. “I look around the league and I don’t see many players impacting the game on the defensive side the way I do,” Green said. “I don’t see many players completely throwing off an entire team’s offense the way I do. So, one thousand percent. Especially with Wemby going down. Seemed like he had it won, and now it’s right there. “One million percent I have a case, and I’ll continue to build a case over these next 13 games. But tonight I think was a prime example of it.”

Текст новости: The Heat currently holds the NBA’s third-worst winning percentage in clutch games this season at 13-23, with its latest clutch loss coming in Wednesday night’s 116-113 defeat at the hands of the Detroit Pistons to open a five-game homestand at Kaseya Center. The Heat led by three points with 4:27 left in the fourth quarter and ended up losing on a game-winning bank-shot three-pointer from Pistons guard Cade Cunningham with 2.9 seconds to play. “That’s the thing that we’ve been racking our time, our brains, everything, trying to find solutions for that,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said when asked if there’s a common thread between the Heat’s late-game issues this season. “We have not come up with solutions, and we’ve pretty much tried everything. This has been one of the biggest challenges of a regular season that I’ve been a part of.”

Текст новости: After Wednesday’s defeat, the Heat has now blown a double-digit lead in an NBA-high 19 losses this season. The Heat has also blown 17 fourth-quarter leads in losses this season, which is tied for second in the league. “The only thing that we have to do now is you just stay the course. You stay with it,” Spoelstra said, with the Heat hoping to end its long skid when its homestand continues Friday against the Houston Rockets (8 p.m., FanDuel Sports Network Sun and NBA TV). “There’s no way to explain some of this, the bank shot at the end. There’s no way to explain that. You just have to find more resolve. “We’re all getting tested in so many different ways that we do not want to get tested, but there can be a beauty in these challenges and these tests if we just continue to stay stubborn.”

Текст новости: Not only is the Heat just 12-26 overall and 6-12 in the clutch since Jan. 2, but it has also been outscored by an NBA-worst 16.6 points per 100 possessions in the fourth quarter during this span. Fifteen of the Heat’s 19 blown double-digit leads and 14 of its 17 blown fourth-quarter leads have come during this stretch. “I think that’s part of it,” Heat forward Duncan Robinson said when asked whether the loss of Butler is playing a role in the team’s late-game struggles. “But that’s not necessarily new to the deadline. We’ve kind of been dealing with that for a while. So I don’t know if it’s as much adjusting to that. I think it’s been different things in different games. Good teams find a way to win, so we got to just start figuring out ways. It’s going to look different on different nights. But it’s more so just about building that resolve on both ends of the floor. These are painful steps, but there have been steps in the right direction.”

For the guys like Jamal and Nikola that aren’t playing, they have such a passion for the game. So they’re not sitting out. There are multiple reasons for it. “This is a team that I can tell you how much they like playing basketball. That might not always be the case with professional athletes. But with this team, we have some hard workers. If they’re not playing, then there’s a big reason for it.”

If we want to make a push in the playoffs, we got to be smart with everything that he’s doing. If he doesn’t play, he’s going to work out. “If he works out, he’s going to work out hard.

Текст новости: But was the 20-year-old, 6-foot-2 shooting guard standing in front his locker, shaking my hand and making jokes, the same basketball player I saw just five months ago join LeBron James, the league’s all-time leading scorer and proverbial “face of the NBA” for more than a decade, as the only father-son duo to play in the same game in NBA history? No, I can’t say he was the same. This version of Bronny James is better. “I definitely think I’ve improved, not only as a player, but just having a different mindset as a player to go out and play my game and play the game that I know how to play,” he said. “I feel really good about it — I see the progress.”

Текст новости: As of this writing, Bronny appeared in 20 NBA games for the Lakers, averaging 1.7 points and shooting just 26 percent from the field in about five minutes per game. Now, if you haven’t seen him, you may be thinking, “This is an improvement?” Hold on a sec. In a recent, close loss to the Denver Nuggets, the Lakers were without several of their rotation players, including Bronny’s dad and new Lakers superstar Luka Dončić. Coach JJ Redick turned to Bronny for 16 game minutes, and though he made just one of the five shots he took, his bucket was a crucial 3-pointer in a pressure situation. He also got to the foul line and turned in a steal. “It’s great that JJ had the level of trust to throw him into a big game the other night at Denver, which is a tough place to play, and he got in the game, made a couple defensive plays, made a corner 3, and I think that’s what he prides himself in is the 3-and-D type of archetype,” Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said.

Текст новости: “I saw consistency coming (before that Cleveland trip), and that’s like the biggest thing I’ve been criticized about for a minute, just being consistent as a player,” Bronny said. “I started to see that, and it kind of drove you to (consider that), well, maybe these people don’t think that I could be consistent as a player, be a good player, produce as a player. So just seeing those numbers and seeing myself on film, I believed in myself more, and that boosted my confidence. That little Cleveland stretch definitely sparked a little something.” In our talk, it was Bronny who first brought up the criticism. Because of who he is, and the history he and his father made, and his draft and contract status, Bronny was always going to have a brighter spotlight on him than any other late second-round pick (or even front-runners for Rookie of the Year or the No. 1 pick in last year’s draft, for that matter).

Текст новости: A player on a two-way contract is ineligible for the playoffs. L.A. has until April 13, the last day of the regular season, to convert Goodwin or Jemison’s contract to a standard NBA deal to have them available for the postseason. But the Lakers already have all 15 roster spots filled, so it would involve waiving a player to make it happen. Cam Reddish would be an obvious choice after falling out of the rotation, even with Rui Hachimura sitting out weeks because of a knee injury. He was already traded to the Charlotte Hornets this season before the Mark Williams deal was rescinded.

Текст новости: Freeing up the other spot is trickier. L.A. signed 7-footer Alex Len to its final roster spot last month, and Len turned down interest from the Indiana Pacers to come, sources told ESPN. Thus far, he has been used sparingly by Redick, with the coach turning to Jemison in backup center minutes behind Jaxson Hayes during L.A.’s recent eight-game winning streak.

Everybody that you’ve worked with, put sweat equity into, blood, sweat, tears all that, coaching staff, fan base, four years I was there, five years Mikal Bridges was there, gone. One night I’m getting ready to play, watching my film, watching whoever was playing, I think it was like a Dallas- Clippers game before that was just finishing up on TNT, and then in a moment everything, all that, just gone. I think the trade deadline has become entertainment and it’s a unique thing for professional sports. Our trade deadline being so viewed, so watched, people anticipating movement, but it’s just like when you put so much into it and a trade kind of sideswipes you like that, it leaves your head spinning, and you have to turn around quick, we played in the Brooklyn uniform two days later.’

Текст новости: Bewildered and in a state of disbelief, San Antonio Spurs forward Sandro Mamukelashvili walked back-and-forth half-dressed near his locker Wednesday night repeating the same words after his team’s 120-105 win over the New York Knicks. “I don’t know what f—ing happened,” Mamukelashvili said. “I don’t know what f—ing happened.” With good friend and rapper Flavor Flav hyping a crowd of 18,521 that gleefully flooded Frost Bank Center with MVP chants, Mamukelashvili made NBA history by scoring the most points — a career-high 34 — in a game when playing fewer than 20 minutes since 1951-52, when minutes became official. “I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time,” Mamukelashvili said. “I just can’t explain how I feel right now. I feel like I’m in a dream. I manifested and prayed for it. I just waited for this day. I really had an out of body experience for a little bit there. I was like, ‘Is this really happening?'”

Текст новости: Mamukelashvili didn’t play in the third quarter. But in the final frame, he lit up the Knicks for 21 points on 8-of-8 shooting, including 4-of-4 from 3-point range to go with 2 rebounds and 2 assists. Mamukelashvili heated up so much that teammate Chris Paul started calling actions down the stretch to get his teammate more looks. “Luckily, I’ve played for a while and sort of know the art of getting guys shots,” Paul said. “Mamu is an amazing teammate. He comes in and works hard every day, cheers guys on, always in a good mood, good attitude. When he’s shooting the ball like that, you just try to find the guy.” Mamukelashvili became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 90% from the field, 100% on 3-pointers and 100% on free throws in a game, joining Tyrese Haliburton (2022), Gary Payton (1995) and Charles Barkley. He also ranks as the third Spur to knock down 7-of-7 or better on 3-pointers, joining Matt Bonner (2010) and Steve Smith (2001).

Текст новости: “We were a step behind all night,” coach Tom Thibodeau said.  They shot just 31 percent in the first half, including 4-for-19 on treys. And even without the towering Wembanyama on the court, the Knicks were still out-rebounded, 52-44.  “[The rebounding] was a big concern,” Thibodeau said. “Particularly when they started the game small and I thought our reaction to the ball wasn’t great. And they’re athletic and quick and we got to make sure we’re putting a body on them. And again, I felt like we were behind all night. It’s better to initiate contact rather than react to it.”

And while he cooled off significantly after the first quarter, his presence again allowed the Lakers (43-25) to take and make wide-open threes all game. Dorian Finney-Smith, Gabe Vincent and Dalton Knecht combined to make 10 threes on 17 attempts. “Sometimes teams send three guys at him. It’s just amazing that he finds the open man time and time again,” Vincent said of Doncic. “He makes the game so easy for us, you know, whether he’s getting to the free-throw line himself or walking to the rim or making a tough shot when we need one or finding the open guy over and over again. … He makes the right read every time and that’s something that’s invaluable.”

This nine-game skid is the Heat’s longest losing streak since dropping 11 consecutive games from Jan. 29, 2008 through Feb. 23, 2008. “There’s not much to be said,” Heat guard Tyler Herro said after the crushing defeat. “Obviously, it’s a tough loss. We’ve lost the last nine. There have been different losses throughout the whole losing streak. Tonight felt like one of those games where we were competing our [butts] off, playing hard and just came up short.”

You stay with it,” Spoelstra said. “There’s no way to explain some of this, the bank shot at the end. There’s no way to explain that. You just have to find more resolve.

Текст новости: The Boston Media Mafia clearly has some work to do because The F5’s Most Underrated Player of the Year goes to Luke Kornet. The seven-foot center is in his seventh year in the NBA and is having the best season of his career. Kornet has already played more minutes this season than in any other season because injuries and mysterious illnesses have sidelined Kristaps Porzingis for more than half his games. The top line numbers aren’t going to blow you away. Kornet is averaging just five points a game. He has more games where he’s put up a donut than games with ten or more points. Meanwhile, only Nicolas Batum has a lower usage rate than Kornet among players with at least 1,000 minutes played. But those numbers don’t come close to capturing Kornet’s impact. When he’s on the court, the Celtics are, to put it bluntly, beating the piss out of opponents. They have a +12.2 Net Rating when Kornet plays — that’s the highest mark among any player in the Celtics’ rotation.

Текст новости: Kornet came into the league as a stretch five, but since arriving in Boston he’s quietly reinvented himself as a bruiser that feasts on shots inside the restricted area. He’s all but abandoned his three-point shot since joining the Celtics and it’s resulted in a dramatic increase in his scoring efficiency. His career is playing out like the reverse of Brook Lopez’s: fewer threes and more dunks. Additionally, Kornet has been a monster on the offensive glass. He has 144 offensive rebounds this season, which is 60 more than anyone else has on the Celtics. His knack for creating second chance opportunities gives Boston a counter punch and forces opposing coaches to think twice before going small unless they want to surrender the battle on the boards.

Текст новости: Risacher, who doesn’t turn 20 until April 8, tied Rockets guard Jalen Green (4) for third in NBA history among teenagers with the most games with 20 or more points scored and five-plus 3-pointers made, according to Stat Mamba. Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards (8) and Grizzlies forward GG Jackson (5) are the others. “He should be, in my eyes, and I’m not saying it because I’m biased, but I think (he) should be Rookie of the Year,” Young said. “What he’s been doing this year, he’s been thrown into the fire as a starter. You put him up against some of the guys in the running. I think his numbers speak for himself, too.

Текст новости: Lastly, what are your thoughts on the NBA internet community calling you the GOATmentator? Beau Estes: I don’t walk into negotiations with Turner Sports and say look right here, I’m the GOATmentator, pay me $10 million. I know it’s not bad right? Like it’s just not but it is something very nice and I know when I die, the one thing I’ll be known for is these Top 10, and that GOATmentator thing, and I’m OK with that. That’s very much what a young Beau Estes would have dreamed about. Being known to be an announcer with the NBA would have been a dream come true. I’ve lived it. I’ve had a dream come true and I’m very lucky for that.

Текст новости: Beau Estes: We’re in competition with everyone who’s putting out creative and great content on the internet and on social right away. We’re not gonna win every eye, so it’s a challenge to do something great, unique, and again this is where I think if we do something unique – like I try to do with the Top 10 – we’re in an advantage because you can only find that where only we do that. But it certainly makes our challenge greater, right? You look out there and look at the amount of incredibly talented people who are doing content with the NBA, not just fun stuff like I do, but in great analysis, fantasy breakdowns of games and stuff like that. It’s just a real challenge, and to take that a step further, what makes it really interesting is if you’re a television programmer – like ours or ESPN – what do you put out there because you need to get as many eyes as possible on it. It’s not just about doing the greatest bit of analysis or the funniest thing you can possibly do. You’re trying to cast a wide net, so they have a different challenge than I have.

Текст новости: What’s the process like of actually getting those Top 10 plays for the day? Beau Estes: And what happens is throughout the course of the evening, a producer is putting together the list. They will occasionally consult with me – they did last night, it doesn’t happen all the time. It happens less than half the time, but if I feel something strongly and I have the time to weigh in, I will. But most of the time, it is a producer sending me a list. I will look at the list one time with the plays and then I’ll just call it. There is no writing involved. There is nothing else. It’s just me watching it one time and calling it with as much energy as I possibly can, and it’s wild because when I’m done with it, I’m like, whew, you feel like you landed a plane with one wing or something like that. It’s almost like a different part of your brain that you just have to go to and find that energy and find that dialect and really lean into it.

Текст новости: On a global level like you just talked about, how did you go from doing NBA to now doing NBL, and now the Euroleague? BE: It started with the NBL, and it was somebody who was a young NBA fan, who got a job with the NBL and says you know who we should hire? It’s that crazy lunatic from the NBA to do our Top 10. So it was a young person suggesting it and I went to Australia and man, they really loved it. We had a great relationship for years and I was lucky enough to do something at the end of the year again with the team in that league and then there’s a guy at the Euroleague who was apparently in a meeting who said the only thing basketball fans around the world agree on is I love that guy Beau Estes from the NBA, and so they reached out to me and hired me.

Текст новости: Appearing on the latest episode of The Kevin O’Connor Show podcast, veteran forward Marcus Morris, who is currently a free agent, was asked by Kevin O’Connor of Yahoo Sports about Daryl Morey‘s recent comments about using AI in Sixers decisions. The question prompted some pointed comments from Morris about the longtime NBA executive. “I don’t trust Daryl Morey. I just don’t trust him,” Morris said (Twitter video link). “I think he’s thinking too far ahead of the way basketball needs to be played. He’s trying to do a whole new team. He’s trying to bring guys in, flipping them in and out, in and out, in and out. Does he even understand the dynamic of being in Philadelphia (and) what guys you need to play in Philadelphia?”

Does the AI tell him to go get Paul George, hire Nick Nurse? “Does AI tell you to get the guy from Miami, Caleb Martin, because he played well in the Boston series? He can’t shoot the ball. You got three dominant guys that need the ball in their hands. Why is that the first guy that you go get? How did you come up with picking a team? Why do you want to start a brand-new team and try to win a championship? I haven’t seen any team that has 10 new guys be really good the following year. I don’t even know if any team has ever done that. “I’m just not a fan of how he goes about choosing players and flipping players in and out. It’s kind of like he’s trying to outsmart the game too much.”

Текст новости: Fears were inevitably raised about fitting in Butler’s outsized personality on top of concerns about his limited range as an outside shooter. Warriors coach Steve Kerr, for that matter, had not previously coached Butler with Team USA and didn’t have an existing relationship with or understanding of him. Dunleavy did. And thus never hesitated. He was confident Butler would quickly buy in to Curry’s gravitas and add to Green’s relentless defense and temperament. To Dunleavy, Butler was a cerebral winner who would quickly find his place within Kerr’s schemes. “I’ve got enough of a history, that familiarity with him, that I feel comfortable with it and it’s worth taking a shot,” Dunleavy said.

Текст новости: The NBA is quietly preparing to bring back its iconic show “NBA Inside Stuff.” On Monday, the league filed two trademark applications for “NBA Inside Stuff,” the name of the long-running NBA highlight show that has aired on three different networks during its history — most notably from 1990 to 2006 on NBC and ABC. The show was briefly resurrected from 2013 to 2016 on NBA TV. NBC is considering bringing back a “refreshed version” of the program, according to a person familiar with the matter. NBC will once again air live NBA games next season after losing the broadcast rights in 2002.

Текст новости: DLLS Sports: A health update for the Mavericks ahead of tomorrow’s game vs. the Pacers. 👀 #MFFL Marc Stein: ‘Anthony Davis really wants to play. There is no question about that. He wants to come back before the season ends. Now, does that mean he will? That remains a TBD because I guess the best way I can describe it is that there are people close to the situation that are not convinced that him coming back is a good idea.’

Текст новости: Marc Stein: ‘And it’s not a matter of the injury he has. They’re not gonna let him on the court unless he proves that the injury he has is sufficiently healed enough for him to play, that’s not the discussion here. But just the discussion is, since this Luka trade I think the Mavs understand this as acutely as anyone, everything that could go wrong for this team has gone wrong. And in that kind of vibe do you want to bring Anthony Davis back and just risk anything bad happening to him?’

Текст новости: Once LeBron is back, what’s the priority on the court for the Lakers the rest of the season? Buha: The priority should be getting the offense on track. Since Dončić’s team debut on Feb. 10, the Lakers rank just 16th in offensive rating. It’s not much better with Dončić and James on the floor together: they rank in the 63rd percentile of offensive lineups, per Cleaning The Glass. Between Dončić, James, Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura, the Lakers have the foundation to be a top-10, if not top-five offense. If they can reach that ceiling and maintain their top-10 defense (they’re sixth since Dončić’s arrival), they have a legitimate chance to beat anyone in a seven-game series.

Текст новости: Under Redick, Vanderbilt and Vincent were asked to be “banshees.” In Irish mythology, a banshee is a female spirit that wails to warn of coming death. Redick sends his banshees out to signal doom for opposing offenses, charging them, “to be maniacs and guard and crash and be disruptive and create pace.” The term was foreign to Vincent but not the concept. “I didn’t really know exactly what to make of it, to be honest with you, using that specific phrase,” Vincent told ESPN. “But I understood the overall message he was trying to have. And it’s the kind of intensity and focus and effort that he needed us to play with and he needed guys to kind of lead that charge with.”

Текст новости: Part of Redick’s strategy to limit the exposure of Doncic, James and Austin Reaves is to have them sag off the perimeter and pack the paint, so they’re not beat off the dribble. “Even their biggest defensive liabilities in Reaves, LeBron and Luka, who is only so-so, are playing well above their defensive standards,” a Western Conference scout told ESPN. The numbers back up the scout’s assessment of Doncic. Since Feb. 10 with the Lakers, he has given up only 0.81 points per direct isolation against him, which is the third-best mark among 23 players to defend at least 40 iso possessions over that stretch, according to Second Spectrum.

Текст новости: L.A. signed 7-footer Alex Len to its final roster spot last month, and Len turned down interest from the Indiana Pacers to come, sources told ESPN. Thus far, he has been used sparingly by Redick, with the coach turning to Jemison in backup center minutes behind Jaxson Hayes during L.A.’s recent eight-game winning streak. A source with knowledge of the Lakers’ thinking told ESPN that having to make decisions about the back end of the roster because the two-way players are standing out is a “good problem to have” and said L.A. would not be in any rush to make a change, using the final weeks of the regular season to continue to gather data points on every player involved.

Текст новости: Many Mavericks fans have closely followed Davis’ recovery from an adductor strain suffered in his debut on Feb. 8. Smith had the opportunity to play with Davis during 5-on-5 runs at a recent practice and saw firsthand how Davis impacts the game. “Luckily, he was on my team, so I saw it from a different standpoint,” Smith said of Davis. “I didn’t want any actions with him before that! But really, just the way he gets to his spots and is unguardable. He can score from three, block shots—what can you do? He’s just elite. When he’s healthy, I can’t wait to watch him in action and see how what he did in practice translates to the game.” While Hardy and Jones are questionable to play Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers, Smith may get another chance to gain practice reps with Davis soon. “I think we’re going to do it again sometime this week,” Smith said.

Текст новости: The Mavericks are one step closer to building a new casino and arena in Irving, Texas—though the team’s departure from Dallas is far from settled. The Irving Zoning Commission approved a zoning change via a 5–4 vote Tuesday that turned a 1,001-acre development area near the former Texas Stadium site into a mixed-use development. The zoning change must still be approved by the Irving City Council, which meets Thursday.

Текст новости: The Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which is owned by the Adelson family who purchased the Mavericks from Mark Cuban in 2023, expressed plans to build a resort on the land that would include an arena that would fit at least 15,000 people and a theater that would have at least 4,000 seats. Casinos are still illegal in Texas, save for a handful of tribe-owned operations. Most forms of gambling, including sports betting, are also illegal, and it’s unclear whether there will be any legislative changes in the near future.

Текст новости: NBA viewership has almost fully rebounded from its much-publicized double-digit decline at the start of this season, with ABC playing a key role. NBA games are averaging 1.58 million viewers across ABC, ESPN and TNT, down just 1 percent from the same point last season. Including NBA TV, the season average of 1.10 million is down 5 percent. Earlier this season, viewership was down in the neighborhood of 20 percent, with most of that decline wiped out by the league’s most-watched Christmas Day slate in five years.

Текст новости: The 6-foot-7 wing returned to the court Feb. 12, but made just five short cameos — until this past weekend. Maxwell Lewis got his chance, and aggressively seized it. “I was thinking, just catch and shoot, be ready. I’m so used to hesitating and putting the ball on the ground, just doing too much. And I felt like [keep it] short and simple, and I felt like I belong in the league. So it felt good to me,” Lewis said. “I just feel normal.” Lewis is out to prove he belongs. He’s younger than every Net other than Noah Clowney and Dariq Whitehead. He’s vying with young wings Jalen Wilson and Ziaire Williams, the latter a restricted free agent with a hefty qualifying offer of at least $7.98 million. Meanwhile, Lewis has team options of just $2.2 million and $2.4 million the next two years, with only $100,000 guaranteed for 2025-26.

I don’t see many players completely throwing off an entire team’s offense the way I do. One-thousand-percent.

Текст новости: Eric Nehm: In a similar vein, Giannis Antetokounmpo talked about the physical toll it takes to play center during that six-game stretch. How do you avoid overtaxing him and finding a balance between getting through these minutes, but getting him to the playoffs in these 11 games? Rivers: We don’t have a balance right now. Bottom line, if Brook’s off the floor, we don’t have another five on our team. Bobby was the five, Jericho was the five and now we have zero fives (outside of Brook). So, it just really makes us a thin bench, a thin basketball team and so Giannis will have to play five and we’re not opposed to putting Kuz at the five, which is crazy, but it is what it is.

Текст новости: While his 3-point shooting volume isn’t high, he’s remained consistent on the shots he has taken. He emphasized the key has been not to overthink minor details about his shot since that can result in him getting into his head unnecessarily. “When I start thinking too much about mechanics, I end up overthinking it,” Edwards said. “For me, it’s more mental—just trusting and believing in the shot.”

Текст новости: He’s continued to gain plenty of chances to be a relief option in the dunker spot or cut backdoor when playing off the ball, but there’s also been more involvement for him to run the offense. “I like that part. And I think nowadays in the league, a lot of offense runs more through the five,” Edwards said. “A lot of times, teams might put their weaker defender on me, so it gives me a chance to come up, set a screen, get the ball, and play off somebody else. I’m more involved that way, and I like that.”

Текст новости: The mentality that makes him one of the people is what makes him so beloved. “I think if there’s one thing that I could point to and say I’m not very good at, I would say it’s being celebrated,” Lillard said. “I think it’s something I need to be better about because I just get uncomfortable about things being all about me. I think part of that is because of how I grew up with so many cousins and siblings and so many people that I’ve always had to share it with. Do things for others. Lift others up. So, that was such a huge emphasis in my childhood, even when I feel like I understand that I might be worthy of it.”

Текст новости: “When I think about my journey,” Lillard said last month from the hallway of his alma mater, Oakland High, “it wasn’t like everybody was on me because I was supposed to do what I’ve done. I was a regular kid. They knew I was good at basketball, but none of this was expected. So when I kind of think back on it, I always remind myself of how important the journey is. “Everybody will look at where I am now, but when I think about the moments of the journey, that’s what gives me chills sometimes about how it happened.” Lillard allowed himself to remember because he was in the halls he once walked. He’d announced a $25,000 scholarship and a partnership with Portland State and blessed the basketball teams with his Adidas signature sneakers.

Текст новости: Pau Gasol: Once I got to the NBA and landed in Memphis from Barcelona, it was a bit of a cultural change. The team had just moved from Vancouver, so everything was new—new team, new franchise, adjusting fans. Memphis was really a Tigers city; the Memphis Tigers had all the fandom. We had to build our own fan base. We were in full rebuild mode, playing our first couple of years in the Pyramid. I remember thinking, Okay, this is the NBA, right? It wasn’t quite how I pictured it. I even asked myself, Is this still my dream? But I reminded myself—I was playing with the best players in the world, and I wanted to succeed. A lot of people doubted whether I could come through and make it. I was determined. I’m going to do it. I’m going to do it for my family. I’m going to do it for myself. I’m going to do it for my country.

Lamar was involved, and instead of going to New Orleans, he ended up in Dallas—the team that had just beaten us. That had to be tough for him mentally. And then I stayed, but things weren’t the same. Phil Jackson stepped away as head coach, Mike Brown came in, and the dynamics changed. We had to adjust. We did the best we could, but it wasn’t the same. It wasn’t good enough to get back to where we wanted to be.”*

Текст новости: Josh Hart on his career season: I think this is the first year for me that I feel like I solidified myself in being a good player in the league. I wasn’t worried about trying to prove myself to anybody. We’ve got JB (Brunson), KAT (Karl-Anthony Towns), Mikal (Bridges), and OG (Anunoby). How can I help these guys maximize their opportunities, kind of be a servant for them, and also be available for Thibs (Tom Thibodeau)? I think I took that mentality and went with that. It opened doors for me that I didn’t think were possible or were in my vision at the time. My biggest thing is I want to make sure these guys are good, and I want to make sure they get the recognition, contracts, and accolades that come with being in their position.

I never thought things would be the way that they are. But when you work hard for something and focus on the team goals, a lot of individual success and accolades can happen. I think I’ve tried to do everything the right way and focus on how I can help my team be the best we can be. Individually, it’s worked out for me. I’m really thankful for the opportunity that came about. It’s something that if I went back in time, I’d do over and over again. It’s something that I’d never take for granted because it’s such a blessed opportunity for an organization like this in a city like this, and to be with my friends and to be with family. It’s been remarkable, to say the least.

Текст новости: Jalen, you said you never thought things would be the way they are, so is there anything specifically that surprised you? Brunson: I’d say I’ve always worked my butt off to be the best player I can be, so the play part, I’m not necessarily surprised by that. I always knew I could achieve whatever I worked for as long as I kept working and had that mindset to never be satisfied with anything, but the things that come with it, like being named the captain, signing an extension, thankfully, being here with my dad (assistant coach Rick Brunson), Thibs (coach Tom Thibodeau), Leon (Rose), and all the guys I’ve known for such a long time like Josh (Hart), Mikal (Bridges), and formerly Donte (DiVincenzo), who I grew up with. There are so many factors where you look at it, and you’re thinking this is something you’d never thought of when making the jump to a new team. That’s what I meant when I said you don’t know what would happen. It’s been remarkable and something I wouldn’t change for anything.

Текст новости: Jalen Brunson on coach Tom Thibodeau and Jay Wright: They’re both maniacs when it comes to their profession. They want the best out of you. They want to push you to exhaustion and make you the best player you can be. They’re both very similar when it comes to that, but they both go about it differently. Thibs, obviously, is a guy who’s known for having that love for the game by staying in the gym and the way he prepares himself and the team for games, which is different from Coach Wright. With Coach Wright, I feel like he pushed us differently. It’s kind of hard to explain, but being in the middle of it and seeing both sides of it. It’s two totally different people with the same mindset and agenda.

He said that’s what makes us champions, so I kind of tried to do the same. It didn’t really work in the beginning, but in the end, I managed to overcome that to really go for my shots and act like one of the legends.”

Текст новости: The short-lived full “Nova Knicks” group may not be playing together at Madison Square Garden, but the quartet will be on basketball fans’ screens together in March — as actors. For a few short months in the 2024 NBA offseason, the New York Knicks’ roster featured no fewer than four players who had previously played together with the Villanova Wildcats — Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, Mikal Bridges and Donte DiVincenzo. Each of them spent their college careers on the Main Line, with all four members of the quartet overlapping on the Wildcats’ 2016-17 squad. The Knicks’ trade for Karl-Anthony Towns in October sent DiVincenzo to the Minnesota Timberwolves, seemingly breaking up the group for good — a reality a new AT&T commercial for March Madness is poking fun at.

Текст новости: Kinda related back to the Thunder, you’ve vouched for Lu Dort to win DPOY. What would your case be for him if you had the chance to talk to the voters? Williams: “For somebody that’s never been on a Defensive Team, it’s already doing him an injustice being that every year he’s had to guard the best player on every single team every single night and done a terrific job doing it. That in itself is already extremely difficult. “There’s no nights off. He goes from Damian Lillard, Steph Curry to De’Aaron Fox. I feel like fans may throw away the fact that you may play a team that’s not doing so well. But then if you throw in like, he’ll have to play LaMelo Ball and he’ll play another team where he has to switch his gears a little bit and has to guard LeBron. The amount of people he has to guard on a regular basis is very insane. I don’t think anybody else in the NBA is doing that.”

Текст новости: Johnson was there to get extra work and treatment before a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Popovich, then at age 75, was there to go through the pregame workout routine that had become essential as he made his way through the grind of an NBA season. But shortly after stepping away from his workout next to the team’s locker room, deep inside the warren of white, silver and black hallways at the arena, Popovich stopped in his tracks. Team staffers who were around while he was lifting weights knew something was off and grabbed him, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. They immediately sat Popovich down. Nearby, Johnson heard the commotion as the coach began receiving medical attention. “I couldn’t see him,” Johnson told ESPN. “But to see how everybody was talking about it was scary.”

Текст новости: Johnson tried to get closer, but Popovich was already being attended to by team staffers who would eventually lead him to an ambulance out of the arena to a nearby hospital. Only a few players, staffers and arena employees had any sense of what had happened. “Nobody really wanted to say anything,” Johnson said. “Nobody wanted to let us in and tell us what was really going on. The unknown was really tough.”

Another source said the coach has advanced in five months of rehab to the point where many who suffer strokes progress over nine months. Still, no one knows yet whether he can return to the sidelines next season, either.

Текст новости: Officiating a game as free-flowing as basketball, no matter the level, isn’t easy. Humans do the job, and they make mistakes. But when it’s an NBA game with thousands of people in the stands and thousands more watching on television or League Pass, the scrutiny of any mistake — thanks to frame-by-frame 4K replay and the proliferation of bettors hoping their parlays hit — is as intense as it’s ever been for officials. James Williams knows this as well as anyone. That’s why he and fellow referee Kane Fitzgerald came up with the idea for RefMasters, a social and educational app with rules-based training for sports officials, during the 2020 bubble season. With the app, users have access to study film sessions and training camps, earn certifications and expand their professional networking opportunities. RefMasters also looks to create data points for interactive training to determine whether a specific position is dependable for an official in the role he or she has on the court, rating it against a large data set of other games where officials have assumed that position or similar positions to predict whether that official is going to be in good position to make accurate calls.

Текст новости: The app is available in more than 35 countries and is free to anyone to use, but RefMasters University is a premium product with a fee of $30 per month or $300 for the annual plan.

Текст новости: As their officiating student numbers continue to grow, the team behind RefMasters is looking to use technology to bring data into the system to create more visibility of what happens during a game as well as potentially predicting what will happen and how to get in front of it. One of the challenges in an area like officiating is that there are many variables. “A lot of times,” said Sony Tiwari, chief executive officer of RefMasters, “when a call is hotly contested or goes to review, the thing that will be analyzed is whether the official was in good position or not. Most of the time, if a call is incorrect, or if there’s a question about its correctness, it will have to do with whether they are standing in the right place and putting their eyes in the right place. RefMasters is interested in using the data they’re collecting to identify what makes a good official. “How do we sift through all the noise and get to the signal? When we think about data, what do you measure with the referee, what percentage of calls as an official get right or wrong? That’s really good, of course, but there’s a lot more that an official brings to a game than making a right or wrong call.”

Back and forth, the G League and then us,” Reaves said. “Then a couple people got hurt, and then [he] got the opportunity to get out there and show what he can do. I told him, I think it was that first game that we played Indiana, he had a hell of a game, and I just told him, ‘I don’t know how out of 30 teams you’re not on a regular contract.’ [It’s] the way that he can affect the game without having the ball in his hands. I bet you anybody that’s played with him enjoy it because he does all the things that are right. Big shout out to him. He’s been a huge factor for us.”

Текст новости: Once I realized the significance of March 13, 1975, I couldn’t resist reaching out to Marv for his recollections on how such a massive NBA news story crossed his desk. Albert explained that he was attending a luncheon at Madison Square Garden when he crossed paths when then-MSG president Michael Burke, who stunningly revealed that the Knicks were trying to assemble a trade for Abdul-Jabbar. Kareem had informed the Bucks at the start of the 1974-75 season that he wanted a trade to New York or L.A., but the parties agreed to keep the trade request quiet to give the Bucks some time to explore the marketplace and put a deal together.

Transition, (they) show a lot of bodies. They’re one of the discipline teams. They did it for 48 minutes.”

Of course, it would have been nice to be one of the best players in the NBA, but for me, playing here is the same. My life here is wonderful, and that’s why I keep my feet on the ground—nothing is guaranteed. I could have quit basketball at 14, and now, at 30, I’m still playing the sport I love, competing in the EuroLeague, in a spectacular city and club.”

Текст новости: As Jabari himself says, simply continuing to play is an achievement in itself. “I like to remind myself—I’m not even supposed to be playing anymore. How many people are playing at a high level after what I’ve been through? I’ve torn my ACL twice, with two meniscus repairs. I shouldn’t even be walking normally, but I’m playing at a high level.”

Текст новости: Shortly after turning 30 years old last year, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was sidelined by a concerning neck injury that forced him to miss the rest of the season. With Rozier turning 31 on Monday, it’s a reminder of how abruptly last season ended for him. “I’m not really a guy who tries to backtrack on a lot of things,” Rozier said, reflecting back on that time. “I just try to move forward and see where life can take me. But obviously, I don’t think anybody wants to go through something like that.

Текст новости: “To have a neck injury and then have to miss the playoffs, which is one of the main reasons that you came to this organization. Then you have to reset all over again, sit out and not do things that are part of your typical summer. You got to work on just trying to get strength in your neck and you can’t touch the court. So it’s a little different. But I just still appreciate everything. I’m still playing, I’m healthy.”

Текст новости: “Do I wish I played better all season? Of course,” Rozier continued. “But I’m just thankful that I can still put a jersey on and play, and I’m still hopeful that things can turn around for me and the team.” Rozier doesn’t want to blame last season’s neck issue on his struggles this season. Even though the injury derailed his offseason and prevented him from going through full-contact basketball work until late in the summer, Rozier is not going to use that as an excuse.

But this summer was definitely different than any summer that I’ve ever been in. Me being able to not touch the ball and me being able to not touch the court for however long that was, was just super different for me, especially being a guy who loves ball and wants to get out there. So it was different. But like I said, I just appreciate everything — the struggles, everything. And hopefully things turn around.”

Текст новости: With the same intensity usually reserved for an opponent trying to disrupt his shot, Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant stood up angrily from his seat. He then shouted toward Suns coach Mike Budenholzer. The picture seemed worth 1,000 words. It captured Durant’s frustration with the Suns’ eventual 107-96 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday at Crypto.com Arena. It conveyed Durant’s irritation with the Lakers’ outscoring the Suns, 31-15, in the first quarter. It showed Durant’s emotions toward something Budenholzer said to him during a first-quarter timeout. “He’s always pushing us to win,” Budenholzer said of Durant. “He’s pushing us to be better, trying to figure out the spacing and sometimes figure out the defense, whether are we putting two on the ball and how we’re rotating. So I think it’s pretty normal stuff. We have to figure it out. We have to be better.”

Текст новости: Durant also exchanged words with Budenholzer after the coach tried to grab his arm during a timeout in the Suns’ game against the Los Angeles Clippers on March 4. The two later conversed more cordially. Afterward, the Suns partly credited that dynamic for the team’s ability to overcome a 23-point deficit over the Clippers. The Suns couldn’t secure a similar comeback against the Lakers, but they pulled within single digits twice with less than two minutes left in both the third and fourth quarter. “He’s pushing himself. He’s pushing us. He’s fighting through a lot,” Budenholzer said of Durant. “He’s a great player. We need a little bit more from everybody around him. We need a little bit more from him. We need a little bit more from me. We need to find a way to get it done. We’re not right now.”

Текст новости: It happened again. “I just thought they were so much more physical tonight,” Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after Sunday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. “We struggled, I thought, throughout the game, getting into our offense. I thought they strung us out. We couldn’t get open, couldn’t get to our spots and I thought that was them.” This time, the Thunder, the league’s top defense by a wide margin, dramatically slowed the Bucks, preventing Milwaukee from doing what it wanted offensively in a 121-105 Bucks loss Sunday.

Текст новости: It’s the same thing that happened last weekend on back-to-back nights against the Orlando Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers. As we broke down after those games, the same thing has happened, at least to some degree, each time the Bucks (38-29) have faced a top-10 defense this season. Despite having two of the league’s best offensive players, the Bucks have been unable to play with the freedom, ball movement and purpose that define their best offensive nights against great defenses. That occurred again on Sunday night.

Текст новости: “When a team plays physical defensively against you, you gotta play harder offensively,” Lillard said. “I think you gotta have better pace and just be more intentional about each part of the plays and the actions that you’re trying to run because they’re trying to take you out of it. So you gotta just be sharper in your pace. “The way that you defeat somebody trying to be physical, you don’t let them get into your body. Your pace is just faster. You’re doing things that keep them off balance from being able to do that. It’s hard. It’s hard offense. Usually the team that jumps out aggressive first is going to establish that and I think that’s what teams have been doing against us.”

We haven’t been as good, I think, on the road this year that we’ve been in the past. Just gotta go take it a game at a time and try to get some wins on the road. “Very important games in front of us.”

Текст новости: The guy who most often receives the basketball next is Jalen Brunson, the “orchestrator,” as Towns dubbed him, of New York’s offense. As of late, the Knicks haven’t had their captain. Brunson is out indefinitely with an ankle sprain. The team has won two games and lost two without him. And one theme is certain in his absence: rhythm gets choppy without a conductor. When scoring goes stagnant these days, Brunson isn’t around to save the Knicks, who need to claw for buckets in other ways. Towns, New York’s other All-Star, is in the middle of the fracas — and not just because he is the clear first option. It’s also because of how a Brunson-less squad has to move. “(We’re) just trying to find different ways to, like coach says, steal points,” Towns said.

Текст новости: When it works, such as during last week’s win over the Sacramento Kings, when the Knicks sprung for 26 fast-break points, the attack looks smooth. A flawed half-court offense isn’t such an issue if a team never gets into it. “I know (where) my teammates are when I’m going up for the rebound. I got a good idea,” Towns said. “A lot of times, I turn, I open up my body to the opposite side and just see. … If the long pass is not there, (I) could get it quick to the guard, and the guard could make something happen: J.B., Deuce (McBride), Josh Hart.”

Текст новости: McBride, now the starter for Brunson, is more of a catch-and-shoot threat than off-the-dribble playmaker. Backup point guard Cameron Payne has lit Madison Square Garden aflame in spurts this season but is mired in a shooting slump. Hart is more of a connector than a lead ballhandler. “Without 11, sometimes we’re not as organized. … When an integral part of the team goes down it’s a different vibe, a different flow of the game,” Hart said. “I’ve got to do a better job of finding myself, finding my game, in that flow.”

Текст новости: The Suns really could’ve used a win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, the same as with any of these games down the stretch, because Phoenix has so inexplicably underachieved that if the regular season were to end today, it would not even be in the Play-In Tournament. In a gotta-have-it game on national TV, the Suns fell by 20 in the first quarter and lost 107-96. During a timeout in that first quarter, a beyond frustrated Kevin Durant erupted in coach Mike Budenholzer’s huddle. It wasn’t clear if he was ripping Budenholzer or the players or both, and afterward, Budenholzer said Durant was shouting about defensive rotations. “Pretty normal stuff,” he said.

It went all right, it went okay in terms of the rehab and how it’s feeling, and just had some other symptoms that were similar to the first one.

Текст новости: Dirk Nowitzki: It was such a strange situation. I was standing in that empty stadium, and then he ran onto the court—in yellow. It was just an unbelievably bizarre moment for me. And of course, it’s going to take weeks and months before it starts to feel a little more normal. It’s a tough situation, but in my tweet, I made it clear—I will always be a Mavs fan. But this trade really hurt. And it will take a while before everyone processes it and moves on.”

Текст новости: Dirk Nowitzki on Luka Doncic trade: I was shocked too. That’s a good word for it. We were on a family trip, had been in Europe for a long time, even in winter, then traveled through Asia a bit. At the end of the trip, we were in the Maldives, just relaxing at the beach. It was literally the last day, and I was in my room, about to pack my things. Then suddenly, my phone exploded with calls and messages from all over the world. I immediately went on Twitter, read the news, and at first, I was just shocked—like everyone else. I don’t think anyone saw it coming that the Mavs would ever trade Luka. So for me, it was totally unexpected, completely out of nowhere. I was so stunned that I just put everything aside. We were supposed to go for a quick lunch with the family before flying out, but instead, I sat in my room for an hour, scrolling through X, trying to figure out if it was real. Some people were saying that the entire trade was fake, that Shams’ account had been hacked. It took a few minutes before it was finally verified. Then I just followed the reactions—every player was posting something about it. The entire league, the entire basketball world was in shock.

Текст новости: Dirk Nowitzki: Then, there were reports coming out. Of course, I immediately texted Luka. At first, he didn’t reply—understandable, he was probably a bit overwhelmed. In English, you’d say he had a lot going on. A day later, he finally responded. I think he was pretty emotional. He didn’t see it coming at all. And then I thought, it would be nice if I supported him at his first game. He hadn’t played for a while—he was injured himself. So, I flew to L.A. I just wanted to show him that our friendship still stands. We played together for a year—my last year—and I always tried to help him, be a mentor to him these past few years. I wanted to show him that I’m here for him, even though he’s somewhere else now. That we have a friendship, that I’m still there for him and his family. His father was there, as well as some of his closest circle.

Текст новости: Dirk Nowitzki: He could have signed a Supermax deal with the Mavs. You can only sign that type of contract with the team you’ve been with for multiple years. But after this trade, he lost that opportunity. He can’t sign the Supermax anymore, which means this trade could have cost him over $100 million. But at the end of the day, Luka isn’t someone who plays just for money. I don’t think this trade hit him hard in that way. As for whether he’ll stay with the Lakers—I think so.

Текст новости: Dirk Nowitzki on Mark Cuban: “I don’t think he has much influence anymore. He sold the majority of the Mavericks over a year ago—more than 50%. Now he’s just a minority owner. I think he still owns a little under 30%, but I doubt he has any real decision-making power anymore. Right after the trade, he said that he had no idea it was happening. And I believe him. We all should. He was always Luka’s number-one fan. He even made a statement once that he would never trade Luka. So it would really surprise me if he had suddenly changed his mind. That’s why I truly believe he had no say in this decision. I think Nico (Harrison) and the new owner pulled this off without involving him at all—or anyone else, for that matter. Of course, that’s tough for Mark. But when you sell the majority of your team, you have to expect that you won’t have control anymore. That’s just how it works. And over the past year, you could already see the team heading in a different direction. Now we’re seeing the result of that.”

Текст новости: The Nets’ leading scorer, whose third hamstring injury of the season has him expected to miss the rest of the schedule, is set to be a restricted free agent. The young guard says he hopes to be back in Brooklyn, but understands the NBA is a business and he can do his scoring wherever he’s wanted. “It was good experiencing all the love from fans here, teammates, front office, everybody. I feel like I built a lot of great relationships here,” Thomas said, before adding, “It’s a business at the end of the day. I’d love to be back and get that straightened out, just to keep playing in front of the fans and keep building relationships that I built here.

He ain’t really have a problem with Kat—the way Kat played—but it really came down to money. They extended Kat before they extended Jimmy. (02:49) And obviously, Kat was on a rookie deal.

I’m on a max deal right now!” Man, that [__] was crazy. I was joking and being cool with everybody at that point. I’m calling Jimmy and Tibs like I’m the mediator.

Текст новости: Dirk Nowitki: Right now, I think NBA coverage in the U.S. is a bit too negative. There’s a lot of criticism—on the playing style, on the players. I want to highlight how great the game actually is, how difficult it is to play at that level. Sure, the game is different than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but that’s just how basketball has evolved. It doesn’t help to sit around and complain that things aren’t like they were in the ’90s. I want to present the game in a positive light, have fun with everyone, and celebrate the sport. I don’t want to be one of those ex-players who just sits there saying, ‘Back in my day, everything was better.’ If I had that mindset, I wouldn’t even take this job. I want to show the players and the game in a good light while still analyzing it fairly. Of course, there will be times when I have to be critical—that’s part of the job. I just need to find my own approach. I’m not the type of guy who enjoys being overly critical or confrontational, so I’ll have to figure out what works best for me.”

They planned to sell it to a media partner. But the owners, of course, came back with, ‘Well, why don’t we do 82 games AND the in-season tournament, so we don’t lose any money?’

Текст новости: Bill Simmons: “You mentioned the alternative league. It’s being pushed by Maverick Carter—LeBron’s business guy. When I first heard about it, I thought it was bulls***. I didn’t think it was real because, initially, everyone thought those guys were getting the Vegas team. I don’t think they have any inside track at all. In fact, there are other groups I would bet on before them. I thought this was a ploy—pretending they were raising money, just to drop it if they got the Vegas team. But that’s not the case. They’ve got a s***load of money for this and a plan. Everything I’ve heard is that it’s kind of real. I don’t know if they have all the money yet, but they have enough. Could you form a six-team league and convince five, six, or seven stars to jump when their contracts are up? I think the contracts would have to be over, but look at Luka—he’s locked in until 2026.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, he was definitely trying, you can’t turn that off. It was funny because Don Roy King, who was our director at the time, who I just saw at the 50th [SNL special] came up and literally brought it up. He goes, ‘If you ever need someone to vouch for this, I know it happened.’ Like thank you, it sucks being the one telling this, you know keeping this apocryphal story alive.

I’m looking forward to talking to him and getting connected — continue to build our relationship going into the next Olympics.”

His assists keep going up. I mean, I don’t know what the guy has to do.’ But I’m not going to campaign (for him to be NBA MVP). I’m not going to do that, but he is a forgotten guy with what he’s doing for our basketball team.”

Текст новости: In 225 minutes across 14 games with the Bucks, Porter has 9.8 points, 2.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 16.1 minutes per game, but he’s also averaging two turnovers per game. His rate of 4.5 turnovers per 36 minutes with the Bucks is a figure that can only be matched by four other players (Trae Young, James Harden, Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant) who have played at least 100 minutes on the season. “That’s non-negotiable,” Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. “Especially late in the season, you just can’t turn the ball over. He knows that, but he’s still doing it right now. But we still want him to be aggressive.”

So for us, winning is very, very important. Creating that culture, competing, and having a chance to play in the playoffs. It’s not just him, but it’s him Tyson, Tosan, and everybody else on that team. Because that’s our club, so we want those guys to do very well. It’s not about Dariq. It’s about us, it’s about the group, it’s about the team. If we do need bodies here, for sure, I’ll be happy to play him. He’s done a good job, he’s worked hard.

Текст новости: This 2024-25 season, which is the first campaign NBA teams have felt the full brunt of the second luxury tax apron in the new collective bargaining agreement, has delivered a further uptick. There have been nine multi-team trades … and the salary cap year won’t be over until we get through the June draft. And even if we don’t see any more three-teamers (or larger trade constructions) before free agency and a new cap year begins, more than a third of the 25 in-season trades that were just consummated required three or more teams to be completed.

Текст новости: For all the considerable hand-wringing about how the league’s trade math has become high-level calculus — and how straying into either of the NBA’s luxury tax aprons would seriously curtail teams’ ability to make deals — there was no shortage of action before the Feb. 6 trade buzzer. It appears front offices leaguewide are just getting more resourceful. Trickier even.. “Teams need to make trades,” said one Eastern Conference executive. “It’s just all going to be more complex. The NBA activated something much bigger.”

Текст новости: One general manager told me that, in conjunction with the rise in the multi-team trades, we can likely expect to see a greater number of draft picks being added to trades to help facilitate activity. The in-season trade business we just witnessed featured plenty of second-round picks changing hands, both as a form of currency when teams can successfully keep first-round draft pick compensation off the table … but also to satisfy the NBA’s “touching” rules. All teams involved in a multi-team construction are required to send out something or acquire something — either player, pick, cash, or draft rights — with at least two of the other teams involved in the transaction.

Текст новости: A crazy story by Jeff Teague about Thanasis Antetokounmpo recently resurfaced across social media. In a podcast conversation, the former player and NBA champion with the Milwaukee Bucks went through how Thanasis Antetokounmpo pushed through to become available for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks after their side fell into a 2-0 hole in the 2021 NBA Finals. “Giannis’ brother, when we went down 0-2, he had COVID. So, he couldn’t come to the plane. That’s why we went down 0-2. Giannis was messed up. Like him and his brother, they got some different kind of connection. He can’t function or play if he doesn’t see his brother. I am being for real. It’s different, bro,” he talked about the relationship between the brothers and how it affected the Freak, “We’re in the middle of the game. I’m like, bro, we in the Finals, bro. Play…”

Текст новости: Following a 0-2 start in the best-of-seven series opposite the Phoenix Suns, the team coached by Mike Budenholzer bounced back with four straight wins to capture the championship. “Where TA?” Teague recalled the constant by Giannis, “TA make this magical like COVID recovery. I know he still had it. Ain’t no way, bro. It’s 14 days, bro. He’s back in three. He’s back. His energy was like contagious. Like he running in the locker room, COVID, everything he got, yelling, screaming. And I’m like, yeah, he matters. Like, he makes a difference for our team. When he’s not here, something’s not clicking. But when TA was there, he made it. Like he mattered. And then somehow, he’s in the locker room, he does all that. When the parade comes, he has a ride by himself because he got COVID.”

Текст новости: Moses Moody had 18 points in 33 minutes, which included what Steve Kerr called the biggest shot of the game — a driving layup with 2:26 left to break a tie at the shot clock buzzer. Moody also made four 3s. He has scored in double digits in 23 of the past 27 games, while also upping his level of individual defense after the departure of Andrew Wiggins.

Текст новости: “It’s his defense,” Kerr said. “He’s really taken on the role of guarding the opponent’s best player or point guard. He’s done it night after night. He’s embraced it. I think one of the reasons we felt so strongly about locking up Moses this past fall (on a three-year, $39 million extension) was just the character piece, how hard he plays, what a great human being he is. Then you look at the length and the shooting ability. He’s clearly a guy who can have a long career in this league.”

Текст новости: D’Angelo Russell would love to be back in Brooklyn. But would Brooklyn love to have Russell back? That’s the multimillion-dollar question. The veteran point guard is headed into unrestricted free agency for the first time, but doing it in a summer where cap space is hard to come by. “I don’t think it’s in my control, to be honest,” Russell told The Post on Saturday. “I’ve been on the team before where everybody was free agents, too. So they’ve got the leverage, they’ve got the cards. If they decide to bring me back, cool. If not, we’ll figure it out.”

Текст новости: “Hope? Yeah. (But) I just want to be in the NBA,” Russell said before the Nets’ 115-113 loss to the Celtics at Barclays Center. “I don’t think I’ve ever been a free agent. I look back on it, I’ve never been. For me, it’s a weird feeling, but see how it goes. I signed an extension with the Lakers, two years — one-plus-one, player option. I just never hit (free agency). So I’m excited to see.” The point guard, who had 11 points and eight assists in Saturday’s loss, is in the final season of a two-year, $36 million deal he signed with the Lakers in 2023.

Текст новости: Coach J.B. Bickerstaff blasted the officials after the Detroit Pistons were called for five technical fouls in the third quarter of a 113-107 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night. During one 48-second stretch, Cade Cunningham picked up two technicals and was ejected, and Dennis Schroder was also hit with a technical. Both players were assessed the fouls for arguing with the officials. “I’m disgusted by the way that game was officiated,” Bickerstaff said. “The level of disrespect was above and beyond. They have a guy fall down and trip on his own teammate’s foot, they review us for a hostile act. They throw an elbow to our chest and neck area, I ask to at least take a look at it (on video). … No one would take a look at it. “The disrespect has gone far enough, and I’m not going to allow our guys to be treated the way they were tonight.”

Текст новости: Afterward, Green said he enjoyed facing a motivated Towns. “It was good to see KAT show up and play like that. Physical. Probably the most physical I’ve seen him play,” Green said. The backdrop was a reckless comment from Green, who spread a rumor on his podcast that Towns missed a game against the Warriors this month at MSG because he was ducking longtime nemesis Jimmy Butler. Green figured Towns was faking an injury, although he acknowledged he “didn’t look that deep into it to figure out what his injury was.” In reality, Towns left New York to attend the funeral of a close family friend who died after a long battle with breast cancer.

Текст новости: Knicks swingman Josh Hart went viral during Saturday’s game against the Golden State Warriors for his heated moment with the Knicks head coach Thibodeau. During a timeout huddle in the second half, Hart began yelling at Thibodeau in apparent disagreement with what Thibodeau was saying. Thibodeau then returned fire and appeared to drop some expletives back at Hart. The two continued to go at it for several more seconds before a couple of Knicks players stepped in and tried to defuse the tensions.

Текст новости: Lonzo Ball missed his seventh game with a right wrist injury on Saturday night, but there’s no plan to shut him down for the rest of the season, Chicago Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. Ball did not travel with the Bulls on the latest six-game road trip, which opened against the Houston Rockets. Chicago has just 15 games left in the regular season. Ball’s injury is on the same wrist that kept him out the first 15 games of the season. Donovan said there’s no timeline for his return, but he has not heard anyone above him suggest that Ball should sit out the rest of the regular season. “I think the intention that he’s doing right now is just trying to get himself back to playing. Doctors aren’t saying, ‘Hey listen, you gotta sit out.’ It’s just when he feels that he can do things on the court that he’s comfortable with,” Donovan said before the game at Houston.

Текст новости: One game after Stephen Curry reached 4,000 3-pointers, it was Steve Kerr’s turn to make history. Kerr became Golden State’s all-time winningest coach after the Warriors beat the New York Knicks 97-94 at the Chase Center on Saturday night. Kerr earned his 558th career regular-season victory, passing Al Attles’ franchise record. After the win, Kerr was presented with the historic game ball by the Attles family, including Attles’ widow, Wilhelmina Attles. Kerr, the Attles family and Warriors players took a picture in the locker room in honor of the milestone.

Текст новости: And though this roster iteration’s ceiling likely won’t become clear until the playoffs, James Dolan seems ready to exhibit patience while hoping for chemistry like the defending champions in Beantown.  “We have a team that’s going to be together for a while,” Dolan said on “The Roommates Show” podcast. “Leon has done a good job of lining up the contracts. So this isn’t our only season. So we’re going to play a bunch of seasons together. You take a look at teams like Boston that have played together, they get to draw off something that they built off that period of time. And for this team, that’s really the challenge today — going into the playoffs, it’s to build that inside of the team.

What you can do to be better. … Just give it time and I think it will happen.”  Dolan’s line of “something we can draw on” is highly interpretative but tangible progress would be a trip to conference finals after consecutive second-round eliminations.

Текст новости: Inspired by Westbrook’s mantra — “Why not?” is the namesake of his charitable foundation and signature shoes — Taehyun Kim left his job after about nine months to pursue his passion for basketball. Six years later, that pursuit led him from Suwon, South Korea, to Denver when the encounter of a lifetime unfolded. Kim was standing in the corner of Ball Arena, near his seat behind the Nuggets’ bench. He was already beaming as he watched Westbrook’s postgame interview on the Jumbotron. He had chosen a perfect game. Vintage Russ had made an appearance, scoring 25 points in a comeback win.

Westbrook hugged the self-labeled superfan and signed the back of the jersey. “How can I express that?” Kim said later in an interview with The Denver Post, searching for the appropriate words to describe the interaction, both in English and in the language of human emotions. “That was like a movie. It’s not a reality. I just said, ‘Oh my god.’”

Текст новости: Slick Watts, the baldheaded point guard known for his colorful headbands as a player and his role as an ambassador of Seattle basketball following the conclusion of his NBA career, died Saturday morning at the age of 73. Watts was a generational figure in the Seattle hoops scene, first as a starter for the SuperSonics in the mid-1970s as a young guard from Mississippi and then becoming one of the faces of the basketball scene in the region once his career ended. Watts had been dealing with health issues for several years following a major stroke suffered in 2021. Watts needed nearly constant assistance following the stroke, often from his son Donald, a former star at Lake Washington High School and UW.

Текст новости: Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro are two of the longest tenured Miami Heat players on the roster. But even Adebayo and Herro are going through an adjustment period after the departure of Jimmy Butler. Instead of leading on and off the court alongside Butler as a trio, Adebayo and Herro are now a leading duo after the Heat traded the disgruntled Butler to the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 6. “It’s growing pains for us,” Adebayo said. “This is the first situation that’s it has really been just me and Tyler. I mean, obviously, the addition of [Andrew Wiggins], but we’re still trying to get Wiggs comfortable to where he can be fully himself. Right now, we’re keeping it simple for him and just kind of getting out of his way. But for me and Tyler, it’s more so understanding that we know how hard it is to win in this league. You can never take that for granted.”

But Herro, 25, has emerged as a Heat leader while also being selected for his first NBA All-Star Game this season. “With everything that has been going on, that part I’ve enjoyed watching — to see them grow into these roles,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Adebayo and Herro. “If you want to lead, these are the times. You have to be able to do it when the seas are a little bit rough, a little bit choppy. “Anybody can lead when things are going great. Anybody can be a front-runner in those kinds of situations. But these guys, they’re about the right things. They want it so bad. They want everybody to play well and get this breakthrough. It starts with that and then everybody else filling in, as well. We say it all the time, it’s leadership at all levels. But those two guys have been around the longest. I think everybody is just kind of turning to them naturally.”

We know when we’re fully healthy and got everybody on the team that we have a really good chance to beat anybody. I just see this group coming together, locking in on one common goal, and that’s to win. “I think (Friday was) the biggest testament to that. Very shorthanded and went and played a really good basketball team with, probably, the best player in the world and went toe-to-toe and had an opportunity to win it and just didn’t execute the last 50 seconds. I guess that’s what you take positive.”

Текст новости: Friday, James was courtside in Sacramento watching his son Bryce and Sierra Canyon win a state title while he recovers from a groin strain. Starters Jaxson Hayes and Rui Hachimura were also not with the team because of knee injuries. Doncic, who scored 45 against the Bucks, didn’t play because of calf and ankle injury management. Key bench players Gabe Vincent (knee) and Dorian Finney-Smith (ankle) also didn’t face the Nuggets. Reaves admitted all the absences left him wondering whether he should get one too, with only James having played more minutes for the Lakers this season. “They told me to go play, so I go play,” Reaves said afterward.

Dwight Powell, Dallas’ only healthy center, played in the team’s three-game trip with stitches in his forehead after he collided with teammate Kessler Edwards on Sunday. Lively (right ankle stress fracture) last played Jan. 14. Gafford (right knee sprain) has been sidelined since Feb. 10. Washington and Jaden Hardy have been sidelined for much of this month with ankle injuries. “We are playing with basically no bigs,” Mavericks forward Naji Marshall said. “A lot of us are 6-7, 6-6 out there. Şengün is an All-Star big. Other guys are 6-10. We are trying our hardest. With what we are doing right now, we have to get through it.”

They attended Vanderbilt’s SEC tournament game Wednesday, held a team dinner and some players and coaches enjoyed Nashville’s famous Broadway district. “Koby’s a great driver of these things,” Atkinson said. “And man, that was one thing we talked about in the beginning of the season, when the season (gets) so long, it’s, how do we keep our guys fresh? How do we keep them engaged? … I do feel a little bit right now with our guys like there’s a little bit of a monotony setting in. And so it was perfect timing for the trip.”

Текст новости: Channing Frye: I genuinely—and everyone who works for the NBA genuinely—wants the Knicks to be good and to go far in the playoffs. You have to be out of your damn mind to just look at stats and think, “Oh, this is normal,” to play your starters an average of 37–38 minutes and think that they are going to be healthy and energetic at the end of the year. You have to relieve your starters so that they can play at a certain level of basketball—that is Knicks basketball. My point was, literally, because the Knicks are good, I don’t want to see them get injured. My perspective is coming from a player who has played with players who have been on Thibs’ teams, where I said, “Damn, if you’re number eight, you ain’t getting no run.”

Текст новости: Of interest when evaluating the Raptors’ short-term future is control of the franchise. Last fall, Edward Rogers, the chairman of Canadian firm Rogers Communications, executed a deal that increased the company’s stake in the Raptors’ parent company to 75%. Next year, he has the right to buy out current governor Larry Tannenbaum’s ownership shares and have full control of the franchise. Just where the Raptors are when that transaction takes place is already a source of both intrigue around the NBA and stress within an organization missing its third straight postseason.

Текст новости: Antoine Walker: Well, Shaq—Shaq pretty much had parties in every city. These were regular. Like, we probably missed—I’m going to say—Utah and Indiana. Maybe those were the only two cities where we didn’t have something planned. And you guys know why—nothing was planned in those cities. But in other cities? We still got it in. It was still happening—it just wasn’t planned, though. But I always say that I never partied and played so much. The thing—I’m telling you, the thing about that season was that you would go party with Shaq, but Shaq didn’t drink. So you didn’t understand—you had to know that you were going to have a great time with him, but he’s not drinking. So when you get up in the morning, you gotta deal with shootaround. Pat ain’t going at Shaq because Shaq don’t smell like alcohol, you know what I mean? Shaq is fine. You? Not so much.

Текст новости: Antoine Walker: We went to a friend’s restaurant, which was actually right down the street from the gym. We were hanging out, eating, kicking it, and playing cards. And we got into this heated Spades gambling game against two guys. They were not players. Next thing you know, they got me and Michael stuck—$100,000. Then it got to $200,000. Then he called home. Then MJ called home and got half a million. This was all cash too. This is a true story. All cash. Next thing you know, we got a million dollars cash—we’re playing Spades. I don’t know if you guys know how to play Spades, but Spades is not a game you like to play for that type of money.”

Oh yeah, and then we would bet $50,000 on the game. So that’s how the numbers got like that. Thirty-six straight hours of it. They had us down $900,000.” “They were Spades sharks, I guess. They had us down. But listen—this is the funny part about the whole story. We got all the money back—except like $30,000. Michael Jordan is such a competitor. He was like, ‘I don’t want to see them with that.

In fact, there was a time when a human-machine combo could be the best (…) But by the early 2000s, that went away. And actually, any human involvement would mess up the machine. A machine with no human involvement would beat any human-machine combination. That worries me. You know, we may face that as well.”

Текст новости: Shams Charania: Going back to your question, though, AJ—the NBA is looking at a couple of other teams. I’m told the Philadelphia 76ers are another team the NBA has started an investigation on. They’re looking into it based on Tyrese Maxey missing time, Joel Embiid missing time, and Paul George also missing games.

Текст новости: Shams Charania: With Philadelphia, it looks a little more legitimate, maybe, because Tyrese Maxey has been banged up all year. Paul George played five games before the All-Star break while getting painkilling injections. I’m told he had to get injected for pain management in five consecutive games just to play. He’s dealing with groin injuries, a knee injury, and a finger tendon injury. I’m also told Paul George is going to visit doctors in the coming days and potentially need a procedure, which would likely sideline him for the rest of the season.

Текст новости: Part of Reynoso’s impact on her son was furthering his appreciation of the media. She was a longtime sports reporter, and growing up, Al accompanied his mother to her work obligations and interviews — just like his son Ean follows his every footstep in the NBA. Horford saw his mother’s frustration and disappointment when athletes refused interviews. So, he assured her that, eventually, he’d be a reporter, too. And, when he was running the show, he’d be sure to help his mom. “When he sees somebody don’t want to give me an interview, he’d say, ‘Don’t worry, I’m going to be a journalist and I’m going to be your producer,’” she recalled.

And I think it’s great, and it’s special for the league, for everybody who really loves basketball — because his spirit and the vibe he has inspired too many players. He’s not done. There’s too many good things upcoming.”

Текст новости: Three months earlier, Utah State was among 12 Division I schools that answered an email from Gomes offering to donate an automated external defibrillator (AED). The eight-year NBA veteran had become an AED advocate in 2006, when Stanley Myers, an 18-year-old who played for the same AAU team as Gomes, died while jogging on the Morgan State University campus because of sudden cardiac arrest. When Myers died, Gomes was in his second NBA season with the Boston Celtics and beginning to form his foundation. He decided he wanted to combat sudden cardiac arrest and vowed to donate an AED to every NBA city. In 2012, after stops with the Minnesota Timberwolves and the LA Clippers, he expanded his reach to colleges, writing to all Division I schools asking if they needed an AED. Twelve schools responded, among them Utah State.

Текст новости: Gomes refers to Berger as “a save” — one of three he knows of because of his donations — and he still remembers getting the call with the confirmation that Berger was going to survive. “Like, you know that these things save people’s lives, but until you get that call like I got from Danny, that he’s going to be fine, it really becomes magnified,” Gomes said. “It’s still a very emotional part of this for me.” At the postgame meet in Utah, Gomes said Berger thanked him and told him how often he thinks about him. “When I heard him say that, it made me really look back and say, ‘Wow, man. I helped someone still be here today.’ And that was very emotional,” said Gomes, now 42. “It really hits home.”

Текст новости: With all due respect to the Portland Trail Blazers’ season, head coach Chauncey Billups plans to take a leave of absence to pay respect to Junior Bridgeman whenever his homegoing service take place. The late Bridgeman, a billionnaire businessman and 12-year NBA veteran with the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Clippers from, was a mentor and business partner of Billups. “I don’t care when it is. I’m going,” Billups told Andscape in a phone interview on Wednesday hours before his Blazers hosted the New York Knicks. “I don’t care. This is somebody that is extremely, tremendously important to me and my life. And I wouldn’t miss it for anything just to be there and pay my respects. He would have done it for me. “He’s enhanced my life in a major way. And I’ve run a lot of major decisions by him. And that’s just how I feel about him. He was the man, bro. I can’t believe this.”

Текст новости: That raises the obvious question: What about LaMelo Ball? Sources said the Hornets have no interest in moving on from their star guard. But setting aside the questions about Williams moving forward after the rescinded trade, the Hornets have Miller, their upcoming lottery pick and this year’s lottery selection, Tidjane Salaun, all as building blocks moving forward. Ball, meanwhile, is already on his second contract. That alone makes it an interesting situation to monitor moving forward. “LaMelo is the question there,” the scout said.

For the moment, that path isn’t clear — and Markkanen can be traded after the season.

Текст новости: When the then-21-year-old came to Sacramento just four days before that year’s draft, having extended his workout schedule so that he could show off for the team that had the No. 4 pick, there was a deeper dynamic at play in this sliding doors moment that would eventually make the miss even worse. The Kings, desperate for a franchise centerpiece who could usher in a new era, were already locked in on Memphis’ Tyreke Evans as the leading prospect. In a twist of cruel irony, Evans’ agent at the time was one of the future architects of the Warriors’ dynasty, Bob Myers.

Текст новости: The Kings had defensive concerns about putting Curry next to the slight-of-frame Kevin Martin in their backcourt and were drawn to the way that the 6-foot-6, 220-pound Evans could get to the rim at will while holding his own on both ends (with the help of his 7-3 wingspan). Curry — who was also behind Rubio and Flynn on the organization’s wish list — was never truly in the running for that spot. And in the eyes of some, his presence that day made it all that much easier for the bigger, stronger Evans to showcase his physical superiority (as you can see below) and confirm the Kings’ leanings about the pick.

The way he changed the game, how important he made the 3-point shot to the game of basketball … “It couldn’t happen to a better person, (someone) who has been a steward of this game, the way he’s carried this franchise on his back, what he’s done for the NBA, the league as a whole.

Текст новости: Now a star for the New York Knicks, Mr. Brunson, 28, took a crucial step toward that goal before the current N.B.A. season when his representatives at Creative Arts Agency enlisted a digital management company, East Goes Global, to create and run Chinese social media accounts for him. In the months since, Mr. Brunson has gained more than 400,000 followers across five of the country’s major apps: Bilibili, Douyin, RedNote, Weibo and WeChat. Mr. Brunson is one of several N.B.A. players looking to establish an online presence in China, where millions of people follow the league closely. But given the language barrier and differing societal norms and trends — not to mention an insular Chinese internet where popular western platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and X are blocked and content is reviewed by the government — most have sought help from companies with specific expertise in navigating the digital landscape.

For the last couple weeks, grimacing through workouts and icing his ankle afterward, he started to jump and cut and move like himself. “We were never going to rush him,” Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “He was able to get four or five scrimmages the last couple weeks. His last two scrimmages you could see were noticeably better. He looked like he had that pop back.”

When you’ve been together with the same group for so long, things can get a little bit monotonous and like, “We’ll figure it out at some point.” When you get a big change like that, it’s like, “Oh, sh*t. We’ve got to figure it out now.” He’s coming in hungry and brings a different energy that we didn’t have in a while. It gives us new life and new motivation. We know the time is now. It’s not time to figure it out in the offseason. We’re trying to win now. I think that message was sent.

He thought the conditioning criticism was overblown as well. “At the end of the day, he’s played World Cups, he’s played Olympics, back-to-back-to-back years. You have to be in pretty good shape to be able to play that,” Green told Sporting News. Green felt that Doncic had grown considerably over his time in Dallas. “I think for someone to be 24 years old and be able to take a team to the Finals, it’s impressive. The last two years, he took a big leap being a leader. The guys really followed that.”

Текст новости: “I told them, ‘It’s time to win,’” Mike Dunleavy Jr. explained to HoopsHype. “Whatever happened this season thus far where we’ve had some tough losses and our record isn’t what it needs to be. This signals it’s time to win, no f****** around. We’ll see where we can get to.” For Dunleavy Jr., being a former teammate of Jimmy Butler with the Chicago Bulls gave him a “level of comfort” in making the blockbuster trade and signing him to a two-year, $111 million extension. “I think there’s a talent level that he brings that we needed at the top of the roster,” Dunleavy Jr. told HoopsHype. “There’s also a presence, a competitiveness, and an IQ. We need all those things on the court and in big moments. I think it raises the level of all of our players. Not only our role players but also Steph and Draymond to know they’ve got another guy with them that they can look around and feel like, “Alright, we’ve got a chance.”

I’ve been saying it for a while. I believe Jordi is going to be a coach for a long time.

Текст новости: Never mind that there are plenty of rival executives who would advise Ishbia and the Suns to consider listening to offers, specifically from the Houston Rockets, who control a significant chunk of Phoenix’s future first-round capital (2025 swap rights, 2027 and 2029 picks, all unprotected) via a deal with the Brooklyn Nets. Sources have told ESPN that the Rockets have repeatedly expressed interest in Booker, a 28-year-old star who fits Houston’s timeline, and that those conversations have been brief. “Never happen,” Ishbia said, interrupting the question. “It’s silly. So here’s what I’ll tell you: I have Devin Booker in the prime. In order to win an NBA championship, you got to have a superstar. You got to have a great player.”

Текст новости: And if they don’t, Phoenix’s front office will again explore all sorts of potential personnel scenarios as the Suns search for solutions while operating under Ishbia’s “all-in” mandate. According to Ishbia, a “pivot and reload” around Booker could be the direction the franchise chooses this summer. The futures of Beal and Durant in Phoenix are uncertain after the Suns engaged in trade discussions involving them before this year’s deadline. The belief within the front office is that the Suns aren’t as far away from contending as the standings indicate. As a source close to Ishbia said, “For better or worse, there’s no ‘trust the process’ to Mat Ishbia.”

And the people that are with us, we just fell short of accomplishing what we want. So I want to do it, and I want to do it here. “That’s the responsibility of being a franchise player, and I wear that with honor.

But at the same time, yes, if we’re not good enough in this iteration of the Phoenix Suns, we’re going to find a way to be better next year. “

I’ve scored 30 points a game. I’ve been an All-Star. I’ve been All-NBA. I want to win. That’s always been my label — I haven’t won anything. So whatever that looks like for the team, whether that’s me coming up the bench, whether it’s me starting, whether it’s me, whatever it is, I’m going to do it. Do I agree with it?

February was especially miserable in Phoenix, as the Suns went 3-10 in a month in which Beal and Durant dealt with the distraction of being involved in trade discussions leading up to the Feb. 6 deadline.

Last year Derrick Coleman, who was the 1991 Rookie of the Year, said he was the first to do it. While speaking on the Knuckleheads podcast with Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson, Coleman was describing his dunk on Shaquille O’Neal during the 1992-93 season. After the dunk, Coleman wagged his finger at O’Neal. “I hit him with that [finger wave],” Coleman said. “See, Dikembe stole that from me.”

So it was cool that for the 4,000 she was here,” Curry told reporters after Thursday’s game. “She got the reponsibility of making sure the ball gets home. Just the idea, like you said, we’ve been all together for a very long time.

As much as basketball is a big part of my life and what I’ve dedicated my life to, it allows me to stay grounded. This isn’t real life, in a sense—you have to find where your strength comes from, why you’re in this position, and what you can do with those blessings. So it always just continues to ground me and gives me a sense of purpose and gratitude for everything that happens in my life.”

When you’ve been together with the same group for so long, things can get a little bit monotonous and like, “We’ll figure it out at some point.” When you get a big change like that, it’s like, “Oh, sh*t. We’ve got to figure it out now.” He’s coming in hungry and brings a different energy that we didn’t have in a while. It gives us new life and new motivation. We know the time is now. It’s not time to figure it out in the offseason. We’re trying to win now. I think that message was sent.

Текст новости: “When guys were traded, it was a rough day for [Warriors coach Steve Kerr],” Hield said Wednesday on 95.7 The Game’s “Steiny & Guru.” “Especially with Wiggs, it was emotional in that locker room. I was even more emotional because I wish it was me that got traded because Wiggs did so much for this franchise. For a guy like that, I hated to see him go like that because he’s done so much for this franchise. “And I said, ‘Man, I wish that was me,’ because he’s put his mark on this franchise, and I know how much he meant to this franchise and the city of San Fran.”

Текст новости: After leading the Minnesota Timberwolves to a convincing win over the Denver Nuggets and Nikola Jokic, Anthony Edwards stayed virtually in Europe and the Balkans. The 23-year-old American winger revealed studying how Slovenian Luka Doncic deals with additional pressure from the defense. “Especially Luka, I watch a lot of Luka. Seeing how he attacks the double team, even though we play in different paces, but just seeing his strategy to beat the double team, I think that helps me a lot,” he mentioned in a media session in Denver’s Ball Arena on Wednesday.

Текст новости: Guerschon Yabusele: I think China, after Boston, was definitely one of the biggest challenges. First of all, we didn’t have a good season that year—lots of problems with the team I was on. The transition from leaving the NBA to going to China was really rough. In my mind, I knew I wasn’t in the NBA anymore, but to really understand that takes time. Everything I was doing, I kept thinking, “Oh my God, this would be different in the NBA.” Every situation I went through, I was comparing to the NBA, and that made it really hard for me to move on.

Текст новости: Guerschon Yabusele: After China, when I went back to France, I didn’t even finish that season. It was so crazy that I had to return to France and stay for a while without a club. I remember sitting down with my wife—she was pregnant with our first baby—and thinking, “What am I going to do?” I got drafted in the first round, 16th pick, and three years later, I had no team. I was just sitting there, wondering what was next. Once I realized that, I changed my mindset. I started working out like crazy, fell in love with the process, and committed to working hard. I respect the game. I had to go back to zero to get to where I am now, and I just keep pushing. That’s why I laugh when people say, “Oh, you’ve got so much energy.” I tell them, “Listen, I come from a tough place. I had to work hard and not cheat the process.”

Текст новости: “We absolutely use models as a vote in any decision,” Sixers president Daryl Morey told journalist Pablo Torre when asked if he utilized large language models in basketball moves. “How much of that decision depends on how much the assumptions behind those models don’t change, and their past success rate. So if you have a highly successful model for picking draft picks, and [the NBA] hasn’t changed the rules yet, then the models get a lot of weight in those decisions. “It turns out LLMs do fairly well at prediction. They still are not beating human, like, super forecasters … They do add signal over just scouts and things like that. So we’ll treat them almost like one scout. Now over time, if it’s shown that they have a better track record than scouts, we might weight the LLMs or use multiple LLMs as one or two votes out of the process.”

The fans get to hear directly from you, unfiltered. I don’t think a lot of people realize how much of what they read is shaped by what gets the most attention. This gives you control over your own narrative, which I think is valuable.

Let’s bring in this guy, and maybe he’ll turn it all around for us. Sometimes it’s a player, sometimes it’s a coach. But you know what I’ve learned? That doesn’t work. It really doesn’t. You have to do the fundamentals, the basics. You have to build the team, build the organization. There is no waving a wand over a team and making it great overnight. It doesn’t happen that way.”*

Текст новости: “For us going into the trade deadline last year we were not competitive if you recall we were not a playoff-bound team and we were able to do some things to reconstruct the roster and enable the team to become very competitive and after the trade deadline last year we actually had the best record in basketball. Which was a big accomplishment and we got to the championship games and we didn’t win and so we had to decide how do we get better. What can we do to improve our team and so we looked at our trajectory during the season and realized that we did not get better but the teams that we competed against some of which we beat, did get better,” said Dumont, “So this was a decision about the future if you look at our roster today and who we have we feel like we position ourselves to be incredibly competitive against the best teams in the NBA.”

He spoke with Sporting News about what he saw from the five-time All-Star. “From my vantage point, you knew what you were going to get from Luka,” Curry said. “Practice, games, when the ball went up, you knew he was going to show up and be ready to play when he was healthy. I didn’t see any issues, really.”

Текст новости: He thought the conditioning criticism was overblown as well. “At the end of the day, he’s played World Cups, he’s played Olympics, back-to-back-to-back years. You have to be in pretty good shape to be able to play that,” Green told Sporting News. Green felt that Doncic had grown considerably over his time in Dallas. “I think for someone to be 24 years old and be able to take a team to the Finals, it’s impressive. The last two years, he took a big leap being a leader. The guys really followed that.”

See the open read like now I know the low man gonna be there, the corner gonna be open every time, then they gon start pre-rotating to the corner, the wing gon be open. Just little reads man, and then watching how other players that get doubled, watch how they attack it and watch how they try to manipulate it. Especially Luka, I watch a lot of Luka.

Текст новости: Just ask Natalie Zito (neé: Gilbert). On Wednesday night in Portland, she was back in the building that changed her life, performing a stunning rendition of the national anthem, the same song that threatened to haunt her had it not been for Cheeks. “I feel like it was yesterday that we were in this moment,” Zito said. It was 22 years ago, 20 seconds deep into the National Anthem, when then-13-year-old Natalie Gilbert forgot the words. If her brain freeze wasn’t bad enough, it felt like the entire world was watching and waiting for the silence to end. It was before Game 3 of the playoff series between Portland and Dallas. In front of 20,000 fans. And a national television audience. “That moment where I was standing there looking around, that felt like forever,” Zito remembered. “But then … he was just like there. Like, the second I turned over my shoulder, he was right there and he was like, ‘No, we’re not gonna do this … you’re gonna finish this song.’ ”

But it was a moment that she believes helped define her. “It made me a much stronger individual,” Zito said. “I can face adversity or anything that’s coming at me. I just push through now, because that’s probably the worst thing that can happen to you when you are 13 and in middle school.”

So, the veteran swingman made a point to tell his new teammates he was committed to winning. “When I walked in, I was like, ‘Yo, look man, I’m only here to win,’” Butler told Andscape. “’I don’t care about nothing else. I don’t care about points. I don’t care about shots. I don’t care about none of that. I’m only here to win and I’ve always only been places to win. So, whatever y’all need me to do, y’all let me know.’ “‘Show me some grace because I’m new until I get the hang of this thing. But the one thing about everything is my energy is at an all-time high because I’m here and ain’t s— changed. The goal is still remaining the same and that’s winning a championship.’ ”

Текст новости: The Butler trade had the oddity of being agreed to on Feb. 5 while the Warriors were on the road to play the Jazz. Both Curry and fellow Warriors star Draymond Green texted Butler at halftime to welcome him. Butler responded by telling Curry and Green to win the game, which the Warriors lost 131-128, and worry about him afterwards. But the sentiment of those texts certainly meant a lot to Butler. “Soon as we found out about the trade, we were getting ready for a game, but also just wanting him to know like, ‘Yo, we are looking forward to you getting here,” Green said. “It’s something that everyone’s kind of been anticipating, not necessarily that we ever knew it would be Jimmy Butler [coming]. But we knew it would be somebody of that magnitude and that we were going after. And so [it was] just kind of letting him know the excitement that we’re all looking forward to him joining.”

I think that’s the ultimate sign of respect. “I talked to both [Curry and Green], but I’ve talked to both of them for a while. But they said, ‘We can do something special. We need what you bring. The winning mentality, the hard nose on both sides of the ball.’ I think that’s what you want. That’s what they told me that I bring and I’m like, ‘Come on with it.’ ”

Instead of going with the double-big look of Bam Adebayo and Ware to start Wednesday’s second half, the Heat began the third quarter with forward Haywood Highsmith on the court in Ware’s place. “[Heat coach Erik Spoelstra] just talked to me,” Ware said of his reaction to beginning Wednesday’s third quarter on the bench. “He told me at halftime what he’s doing and I was like, ‘OK, I got it.’”

Текст новости: Ware ran into similar issues during Monday’s loss to the Charlotte Hornets against center Mark Williams, recording just two points on 1-of-6 shooting from the field, five rebounds and three assists in 23 minutes in that defeat. The Heat was outscored by 12 points with Ware on the court in that game. “He can definitely see the physicality, the girth and he’s gained a lot of strength in the weight room,” Spoelstra said of the lessons that Ware can learn from going up against centers such as Zubac and Williams this week. “But now there’s also functional strength, technique and really competing against guys that are trying to take advantage of that post opportunity or catches in the paint. That’s happened now a few times. “The size, the strength, all that, we need that right now from him. And he’s learning everything from a fire hose, but this is actually the best way to learn is when there’s consequences to everything because everything becomes so much more magnified.”

Текст новости: Zubac totaled 26 points and 14 rebounds on Wednesday against the Heat. Williams totaled 24 points and 10 rebounds on Monday against the Heat. “Those are guys who have been in the league for a minute and I’m still learning through it,” Ware said. “So I don’t really think it’s tough. I just think it’s more of a lesson to learn, look back on it and get better next year.”

Текст новости: But Ware’s youth and inexperience have also been on display, especially recently. “I feel like I’m progressing every game, every practice,” said Ware, who continues to work behind the scenes to add weight to his slender frame. “Just trying to get better. Of course, this season isn’t going how we all hoped it would go. But I’m still treating every day like I want to get better and I want to progress because I know my second year is going to come around quickly. So I just want to be prepared for that.”

I don’t know what, but it seems we are not playing good against them, or maybe they don’t let us play good against them,” pointed out Nikola Jokic in a postgame press conference following Wednesday’s game. “I want to win every game, so if I lose, I don’t think any loss is really easy for stomach,” he furthered, “When someone beats you so many times in a row, it’s something you need to figure out, you need to think about it.”

Текст новости: A heavyweight wrestling match broke out Wednesday night at the Toyota Center, resulting in the ejections of a pair of big men: the Houston Rockets’ Steven Adams and the Phoenix Suns’ Mason Plumlee. “Their aggressive actions were considered a fight, and by rule, fighting technical fouls carry a penalty of automatic ejection,” crew chief Tony Brothers told a pool reporter. Adams and Plumlee got tangled up while battling for rebounding position on a made jumper by Houston’s Jalen Green with just over three minutes left in the second quarter. Seconds later, they ended up on the floor with a scrum of players, coaches and security staffers around them.

Текст новости: The Knicks entered Wednesday near the bottom of the NBA in bench points — at least partially a product of the starters eating up so many minutes. Still, the reserves enjoyed an uptick in production recently with Robinson and Shamet getting comfortable.  “We’ve started the season with Landry hurt and Deuce [McBride] not 100 percent. So our wings did play more,” Thibodeau said. “So are they playing a little bit more than I would like? Yeah. Probably 35 or 36, and that’s where Mikal is if you look at the last 10 games — he’s playing 35 minutes per game and four of those games are overtime games. So that’s the reality. Now that Deuce is healthy, those minutes are going to come down. So that’s the way it is.”

Текст новости: The surgery option would’ve ended Shamet’s season but offered greater odds of a full recovery without a setback. He took the less certain health path — which also meant the Knicks re-signed him in December. It was rocky for a bit, with Shamet going in-and-out of the rotation. But he’s rediscovered the 3-point shot, hitting 44.8 percent of the time in the previous 13 games, before missing his only attempt Wednesday. There’s also a trickle-down opportunity with the injury to Jalen Brunson, thrusting Miles McBride into the starting lineup and Shamet as one of just two guards off the bench. “You have to be prepared for all scenarios, especially if you’re thinking about the postseason,” Shamet said.

Текст новости: The Atlanta Hawks have found several ways to win in their last four games, and tonight was much different than the past three. In their game against the Philadelphia 76ers, they got the win without Trae Young, but in their latest win against Charlotte Hornets, they needed 21 free throws from him, which led to him making history. Young went a perfect 21-21 from the free-throw line and is the sixth player in NBA history to go perfect from the free-throw line with 21 or more attempts in a single game. After the game, Young spoke about the 21 free throws and being able to come through at the line when the team needed him. “It’s what I do,” Young said. “I know how to score. If my shot’s not going I know how to get to the line. It not only helps our team score, it also puts them in foul trouble and stuff like that, especially when guys are being as aggressive as they’ve been.

Текст новости: The night before Halloween, Ja Morant scored on the Nets’ Keon Johnson, and then he let Johnson hear about it for the entirety of his jog back on defense. By the free throw line, Johnson had his chest pressed into Morant’s and there was zero chance the words filling the air were G-rated. Quick double technicals were called, meaning that about 35 minutes of playing time into his season, Johnson had become this season’s first NBA player to be ejected for being saucy. But not the last. A quick tour of the Spotrac database shows players are getting ejected fighting-or-close every few days. Click through the table for a list of ejections as of a few days ago (edited to remove those are clearly for off-court or nonviolent infractions).

They can get away with more. It’s just a math formula–stronger men, super competitive mindsets, tired minds, and less trust in the system to keep things fair. An NBA coach just told me that “they don’t call fouls anymore.” I argued with him–try touching a superstar while he’s driving! But he looked at me like, no, I’m not fucking kidding. Like, what are you talking about? It’s physical.

Текст новости: So to find out and once and for all which refs tend to call a tight game I took a more calculated approach. Using Ken Pom’s Fouls Above Average (FAA) for college basketball as a guide, I looked at how many fouls a referee calls relative to an average NBA referee by controlling for factors like: * the margin of victory (close games have more fouls — particularly at the end) * the number of possessions in the game (more possessions means more fouls) * the foul tendencies of the teams that were playing * the referee’s position (crew chief vs. referee/umpire) * the other members of the officiating crew I tried to control for each referee’s height to test ESPN’s Tim McMahon’s theory that shorter refs call more fouls, but I couldn’t find a source for referee combine data.

Текст новости: When building a referee metric, a good sniff test is to see where Scott Foster ranks. The more uptight he looks, the better your metric smells. To no one’s surprise, Foster has the highest FAA over the last five years, which makes him the NBA’s biggest whistleblower. What Fosters +2.31 FAA means in practice is that all else equal we’d expect to see Foster blow his whistle about two more times than a league average referee over 100 possessions. Hypothetically, if you replaced Foster with Intae Hwang (-2.39 FAA), then you’d expect nearly five fewer whistles. (I say “hypothetically” in the most literal sense because Hwang has never served as a crew chief, which is Foster’s typical assignment.)

Then 13 years old, Gilbert stumbled on her words and mixed up “twilight’s last gleaming” with “stars last gleaming.” Up stepped Portland’s then-head coach Maurice Cheeks, who stood side-by-side with Gilbert to encourage her, saying, “C’mon,” before singing “stars last gleaming” with Gilbert. The former Philadelphia 76ers guard continued to sing alongside her, and the crowd joined in as well. Cheeks and the teenager belted “home of the brave” together, and Cheeks gave her a hug to close out the heartwarming performance. They later appeared on “The Tonight Show” and CNN.

After he was released by the Boston Celtics during the 2019 summer league, Yabusele signed with the CBA’s Nanjing Monkey Kings. COVID cases began publicly surfacing as Yabusele approached his 2020 All-Star break, during which he and his pregnant wife had a vacation planned to Thailand.

Текст новости: Monkey Kings reps called Yabusele daily with updates on skyrocketing cases, eventually suggesting that they go to their home country of France after their vacation rather than return to China. When the Yabuseles put on masks upon arriving in Paris, people looked at them “like we’re crazy,” he recalled. “Yo, something’s coming,” they responded. “We were there, and it’s scary.”

Текст новости: So when the league shut down about a month into adjusting to his new surroundings, the center initially thought, “Damn, what am I going to do with myself?” He hopped onto a plane to Miami, where he and his best friend planned to stay at a local luxury hotel. While they were getting drinks, though, the bartender abruptly declared that she could no longer serve them. “I’m like, ‘I’ve only had one drink. You’re cutting me off already?’” Drummond recalled. “She’s like, ‘No, did you not see?’ They put the news up there [on the TVs] … and everything is closed, starting now.”

Текст новости: To that end, the NBA came up with two different mechanisms before the 2023-24 season to punish flopping: a non-unsportsmanlike* technical foul that can be whistled on the spot, and a $2,000 fine that can be administered after the fact if a call was missed during the game. The preseason and beginning of the regular season in 2023-24 saw a surfeit of these calls, but they gradually faded as the year went on. Based on a search of Spotrac’s fines and suspensions database, there were eight flopping fines handed out in the first week of 2023-24 and 22 in the first half of the season, but only four after Feb. 1. (Only one player was fined more than once for this last season, and it wasn’t Dort or Dončić or Smart or Dillon Brooks. It was … Collin Sexton?) However, in 2024-25, the fine has diminished to nearly nothing. We’ve only had five the entire season, with only the most egregious dives warranting action from Joe Dumars’ office.

Текст новости: The league’s big-picture aim was to get the most egregious acting out of the game. With that in mind, the league has a very specific definition of what constitutes a tech-worthy flop. It calls the criteria “STEM” which stands for secondary, theatrical, exaggerated movements. “STEM is,” said Monty McCutchen, the league’s senior vice president, head of development and training for referee operations, “there’s contact, and then there’s a reaction, and then there’s a pause and another reaction, so secondary. “And then there’s theatrical and exaggerated movements. Some of the indicators of that are: Are there multiple rollovers? Is there a large distance covered that is not equitable to the contact? Is the reaction consistent with the amount of contact that was taken? If those things are not met, then secondary, theatrical and exaggerated movements should be penalized with a flopping violation.”

Текст новости: “What I want is, if they say this is going to be the rule and we’re going to enforce it, for them to just execute on that because then we know what to expect, and we can adjust,” Daigneault said. “But when they put a rule in, and they just get disinterested or they stray away from that, it’s very difficult for us to adapt to that. “So I don’t care what their rules are, but if they’re going to put it in, and they say this is a flop, call it on everybody.”

Текст новости: Lou Williams detailed more about where the superstar shouldn’t go on the Run It Back FDTV Show. “With the (Los Angeles) Lakers, with the (Dallas) Mavs it’s going to be the same old narrative,” Williams said. “It’s going to be the same conversations, same critiques, and criticism every time they lose a game or they don’t go on a run that we expect them to go on. It’s going to be the end of the world, you don’t want to end your career like that.”

Bron, of course, ignited the feud with the ESPN commentator while the two were at Crypto.com Arena for L.A.’s March 6 tilt with the Knicks … after he had gotten upset over the way Stephen A. had previously spoken about Bronny James.

Текст новости: Castle, however, is coming on quickly. He went through some early slumps, including his first eight games of the season and a 12-game stretch when he moved to the bench in December. Those games account for one-third of his season and are primarily responsible for why he has a true-shooting percentage that is 10 percent below league average. However, no rookie in the league is playing better right now. Over his last 19 games, Castle is averaging 17.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists while shooting 46.4 percent from the field, 32.9 percent from 3 and 72.8 percent from the line. His true-shooting percentage over that time has spiked up to 55.4. He’s a tough-minded defender who takes on difficult assignments nightly and consistently creates deflections and steals.

Текст новости: The Ware impact on Miami’s offense can’t be overstated. When he’s out there, the team averages 115.4 points per 100 possessions and wins its minutes by 1.9 points per 100. With him off the court, the team averages just 111.7. That’s the difference between the eighth-best offense in the league and the 20th-best offense. And then when the team plays the dual-big starters with Ware and Bam Adebayo, things get even better. The team averages 116.8 points per 100 and only gives up 110.6. Even more than just Ware’s game, it’s helped unlock Adebayo, who was in the midst of a down offensive season. In the minutes that Ware and Adebayo play together, per PBP Stats, Adebayo shoots 62.4 percent from 2-point range. In the minutes when Ware is off the court, Adebayo shoots just 52 percent inside the arc. His true-shooting percentage with Ware skyrockets to 67.4 versus 53.5 without him on the court. He’s given Adebayo some more space to operate, and it’s helping the Heat significantly.

Текст новости: I know team goals haven’t necessarily panned out this year, but you were out there putting up big numbers. I think you had 10 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists in the fourth quarter. The people who showed up looked delighted to see it. You had a lot of emotion. Could you take us through the significance of this final stretch and how it relates to your future? Zion Williamson: This is when it comes down to being a pro and deciding what you want to get out of it. We talked about it as a team. The season hasn’t gone the way we wanted, but that doesn’t mean we can’t build into something for next year—build better habits. Like I said, it’s about consistency. When we take a lead, we have to maintain it instead of just being front-runners. How we lock into the scouting report, how we function as a team—all of that matters. We’ve got to build on that. When summer comes, we need to stick together, and by the time the season starts, we’ll be locked in and ready to go.

Текст новости: Veteran NBA reporter Brian Windhorst told ESPN he expects the Bulls to re-sign Giddey for a contract worth around USD $30 million (A$47 million) per season. “This is the kind of play I thought he (Giddey) would have all year,” Windhorst said. “His role was sort of limited. After the trades they’ve opened up his role (and) this is the player he can be. “The going rate for a starting point guard in the NBA is around thirty million dollars. He is their starter. “If you look at a guy like Immanuel Quickley, he got five years and $162 million (A$257 million) — that’s about $32 million a year. I’m sure Josh Giddey’s hoping for something like that.

Текст новости: Antetokounmpo wanted a review of the foul called on him that would send Haliburton to the free throw line for a potential four-point play and the lead. Bucks head coach Doc Rivers did challenge – to see if Haliburton had been out of bounds – but the review was lost. Haliburton the made the free throw, and Antetokounmpo’s pull-up 28-footer at the buzzer missed its mark. “I think there was a miscommunication on our coverage, he was able to get to the corner and knock down an incredible shot,” Antetokounmpo said “Gotta give him credit. That was pretty much it,”

Pozzecco confirmed that he’s trying to sign DiVincenzo up as a naturalized player for this summer’s tournament. “We’re working on the DiVincenzo case and I’ll go and talk to him soon,” he pointed out. “It would be helpful. But what’s needed is a passport, which he doesn’t have today, and the willingness to play, which exists,” he added. “However, that must be confirmed at the call, in order to avoid other cases like [Paolo] Banchero,” he said, referring to the All-Star forward’s talks with Italy before opting for Team USA.

You know, they always tell us stories about how 75% of athletes, two to five years after they’re done playing, go broke, and I never wanted to be that. So I always started looking at people—Michael, of course, Magic—but I remember one time the Forbes list came out, and I was like, Oh, I know I’m on this list with all the commercials I do. But then I saw his name. I reached out to him, and we started talking. He had Wendy’s, so I started Big Chicken. You know, Pepsi and Coke—everything that he did, I tried to pattern after him. I actually just talked to him the other day because we were getting ready to do business. My condolences go out to his partner, Charles, to his family, his daughter, and his son. This one really hit hard for me because he was definitely somebody I looked up to. I know I get a lot of credit—Oh, you do this and you do that—but if it wasn’t for Bridgeman, I wouldn’t have known where to start.

Текст новости: “We’ve got to do a better job at moving the ball from side-to-side,” Magic center Wendell Carter Jr. said. “Defensively — even with their offensive rebounding, which we definitely got to cut out when playing against teams like that — we held them under 100 points. That’s impressive in an NBA game.

Текст новости: On why men, particularly in the Black community, don’t like to discuss health concerns, but why his father’s prostate cancer prompted him to get checked out: Dwyane Wade: “So I didn’t have any issues in my kidney…. In the Black community, a lot of things are not shared. And so, especially health, no one talks about their health. And, you know, a lot of us Black men in the Black community, we don’t talk about health. We don’t want to go to the doctors. We don’t want to know anything…. But that’s the way we were conditioned to think. And so what I did is, I went in and I just was like, ‘Hey, my dad is dealing with this. I now know that this is a part of my genetic gene. I just want to get a full scan of my entire body.’ And that’s kind of how it was eventually discovered.”

And so right now it is gonna be done by a committee and a collective until someone goes and takes the baton. Like, it can’t be something that’s given. It has to be something that the fan base just falls in – they have to fall in love with all things about you. Like being a good basketball player and having the stats and having the statistics, that doesn’t make you the face of the league. That makes you a very good basketball player. Like my wife say, we gotta care about what you eat. We gotta care about who you dating. We gotta care about all things about you for you to be the face of this league.

Junior was the ultimate entrepreneur who built on his impactful 12-year NBA playing career by becoming a highly respected and successful business leader. He served as a mentor to generations of NBA players and athletes across sports who were eager to learn from him about what it takes to thrive in the business world. Junior was a dedicated member of the NBA family for 50 years – most recently as a minority owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, an investor in NBA Africa and as a player who set the standard for representing the league and our game with class and dignity. “We express our heartfelt condolences to Junior’s wife, Doris, their children, Eden, Justin and Ryan, the Bucks organization, and his many friends and admirers in the basketball community.”

Текст новости: The fact that Irving is considering zoning changes even as the Mavericks and city of Dallas discuss arena possibilities are seemingly strong indications of Sands’ interest in North Texas with or without gaming – potentially building multiple projects. Certainly, the fact that the Mavericks want to identify an arena site within 12 months does not align with Texas’ current gaming timeline, which at best is murky. “The ongoing situation in Irving is about potential future development and getting the site ready for the possibility of a destination resort,” Sands spokesperson Ron Reese told The News on Tuesday. “As we’ve said in the past, we’ll continue to evaluate other sites in the Metroplex — including in the city of Dallas.”

Текст новости: What did it mean to you to return to Brooklyn? D’Angelo Russell: It’s great. I would never take it for granted, coming from where I came from. Obviously, I was a little traumatized there. To be here and get the opportunity to just be me where there’s familiarity as well is just icing on the cake. I’m at the point in my career where I’m not going out and scoring 25 points every night and wowing with numbers. It’s a point where I’m trying to gravitate towards doing it the right way, and how I can contribute to winning is my priority. He (Coach Fernandez) lets me do that. He trusts me already, so I can imagine getting to training camp for something like that and having that under my belt with the guys. I think the sky’s the limit.

Текст новости: How would you describe your relationship with Jordi Fernandez behind the scenes? D’Angelo Russell: I just appreciate it more than anything because I’ve come from places where I don’t have that relationship. I’ve kind of just had success off of just showing up and no relationship. With JJ (Redick), I had a solid relationship with him on the way out. I told Jordi today for him to trust me and allow me to be a basketball player and not just a shot maker. If my shots aren’t falling, he still trusts me to be out there to make plays. I respect that more than anything. I’ve been kind of categorized as a guy who only makes shots, but being a basketball player is my strength. For him to trust me so soon since I’ve been here, I’m nothing but appreciative.

Текст новости: This season, Coulibaly has more than doubled his touch-time average (3.25 seconds per game) from his rookie campaign. That has led to an increase in opportunities as a scorer and playmaker. Through 56 games, Coulibaly is producing 12.4 points and 3.5 assists a night. Further, he has upped his potential assist per-game average to 6.6 from 3.1 in his first year. “Work a lot and just confidence [have led to that growth],” Coulibaly said echoing Relph’s words. “Confidence from my teammates, confidence from myself, coaches giving me the ball. I know I can create, so it’s just me and my aggressiveness.”

Текст новости: James’ agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports commented on the injury during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show and wasn’t willing to put a timetable on a potential returning, deferring to LeBron and his training staff: “I think you have to manage it. Obviously you see the reports that are out there and you have to pay attention to LeBron in terms of his postgame interview. He knows his body better than anybody. So we kind of have to follow him there. But look, he’s played a lot of basketball. All of these guys, coming off the Olympics, they’re playing across our league. So there’s been a lot of basketball played. For the older guys that have this type of injury, you have to manage it properly. Unfortunately, AD had the same thing. A little bit different, and [LeBron] even mentioned that as soon as he did it, the second thing he thought about was that. So you have to manage it with grace. Obviously the Lakers have a tough schedule coming up, I think they have six games in eight nights or something like that and they play some pretty top-heavy teams, they have the No. 6 most-difficult schedule to finish the season out. It’s tough. Look, they have a lot of work to do regardless of whether he was there or not just with the roster. But those guys have been playing an unbelievable brand of basketball and JJ has those guys prepared. They lost the other night by not being prepared, I didn’t think they executed well on either side of the floor and they were not able to beat the Nets last night, but that comes from I think in some cases not respecting your opponent. This is still the NBa and anybody can beat you on any given night. But you gotta handle it with grace. I won’t put a timetable on it, I’ll let LeBron decide what’s to be done there. He has a great trainer and medical staff with the Lakers and Mike Mancias leads that for him. I’ll just be lockstep with those guys.”

Текст новости: Jonathan Kuminga had a three-on-three workout in Philadelphia and I was in the gym afterwards and you could tell the ankle was still bothering him, he was grabbing at it, talking to the trainers. I saw him that night after the game in Philly, which he didn’t play in obviously, but he was still icing his ankle postgame, there’s just been some residual swelling so this last stage of rehab is just taken longer than they thought. They kind of projected he might be back around last week but I could see him Thursday night. He’s had a couple good scrimmages this last week, you’re going to see him very soon, like I said maybe as early as Thursday.

Текст новости: Since the Heat traded the disgruntled Butler to the Warriors on Feb. 6, the Heat has gone 4-11 and the Warriors have posted a 12-1 record in games Butler has played in. In other words, the Heat has been bad and the Warriors have been excellent since the deal. “Just a tough loss,” Heat guard Tyler Herro said following the Heat’s latest setback Monday, with the 0-3 five-game homestand continuing Wednesday against the Los Angeles Clippers (8 p.m., FanDuel Sports Network Sun). “We got to find a way to get ourselves out of this hole. This isn’t fun for anybody. It’s a tough time right now. But we’re staying with it, we’ll figure it out. We really can’t blame anybody but ourselves and we just got to continue to stay in the fight. Can’t let go of the rope.”

Текст новости: The Heat has also blown a double-digit lead in 17 losses this season, which is the second-most such collapses in the NBA this season behind only the Utah Jazz (18 blown double-digit leads). “We just have to forge ahead,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said late Monday night before the team went through practice at Kaseya Center Tuesday morning, continuing to take a hopeful and optimistic tone despite the rough patch that the team has hit. “You have to forge. Sometimes you get tested in a way that you don’t want to be tested in this league. And you can fold the tent or you just keep on forging and forging and forging. And that’s what our group is going to do.”

Текст новости: Walsh mostly fell out of the rotation with the roster fully healthy but has seen increased on-court opportunities more recently, tallying 21 minutes in a Celtics win over the Blazers and 13 minutes against the 76ers. His only Maine Celtics appearance this season came at his request: “I would have been just sitting in my crib doing nothing. This is a way better alternative.” Regardless of the fluctuating on-court opportunities, Walsh has embraced the mentorship he’s received from the Celtics’ more veteran players. “Being the youngest on the team, I think that he’s learning so much from these vets,” Sandra said. “And I love this team. I really do.”

Текст новости: To this day, his mother still views basketball as a saving grace. “When he was first diagnosed, we didn’t know what was going to take his mind off of it,” Sandra said. “So, I see basketball probably a little different than other mothers.” “It saved my son, literally, from a life of insecurity and pain and that kind of suffering that I see. The fact that he’s become such a figure, an image, and a mentor for other kids with alopecia — and he’s been able to do that through basketball.”

Текст новости: For high-volume passers like Dončić, the bigger results might not even be in his shooting stats but in everyone else’s. The study noted that Chris Paul’s first season with the Phoenix Suns saw his teammates shoot an effective field-goal percentage of 46.6 in his first two months and 72.3 over the final 20 games. The Suns began the season 8-8 and eventually made the NBA Finals. In another example that is perhaps more relevant to the current discussion, Alamar and Oliver also noted that Kyrie Irving shot dramatically worse on passes from Dončić in his first season with him — one that ended with Dallas in the draft lottery — than in the second one that ended with the Mavs as Western Conference champs.

Текст новости: Going back further, the lack of chemistry in the first season of Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo playing together in Milwaukee was palpable, as they hardly even ran pick-and-roll together; that partnership has become much more potent. Similarly, any semblance of the Dončić-LeBron James two-man game has been MIA since Dončić joined the Lakers. The good news for L.A. is that the worst parts of this effect are on the earliest games together, as you might expect. The presenters’ charts showed a sharp curve over the first several shots that flattened over time but whose slope never quite reached zero. In other words, it’s still probably marginally helpful that Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are building even more chemistry in Year 8 together, but vastly greater gains are available for recently thrown-together teammates like Dončić and James.

Текст новости: Based on a search of Spotrac’s fines and suspensions database, there were eight flopping fines handed out in the first week of 2023-24 and 22 in the first half of the season, but only four after Feb. 1. (Only one player was fined more than once for this last season, and it wasn’t Dort or Dončić or Smart or Dillon Brooks. It was … Collin Sexton?) However, in 2024-25, the fine has diminished to nearly nothing. We’ve only had five the entire season, with only the most egregious dives warranting action from Joe Dumars’ office. (Those fines are made in consultation with the officiating side, by the way.)

Текст новости: This was always designed to be a relatively rare penalty, rather than to “A-ha!” any player with the temerity to fall down after something less than bulldozer contact. The league’s big-picture aim was to get the most egregious acting out of the game. With that in mind, the league has a very specific definition of what constitutes a tech-worthy flop. It calls the criteria “STEM” which stands for secondary, theatrical, exaggerated movements. “STEM is,” said Monty McCutchen, the league’s senior vice president, head of development and training for referee operations, “there’s contact, and then there’s a reaction, and then there’s a pause and another reaction, so secondary.

Текст новости: Jokić is in the top three of the NBA in points, rebounds and assists, a feat no one has previously accomplished for a full season. He’s pacing to become the second player since 1962 to average a triple-double for a full season. The Nuggets, with Monday night’s win, are in sole possession of second place in the West, and that’s important to contextualize because Denver is not as good as it was in 2023, when it was the best squad in the league by far and steamrolled to the NBA title. “This is my third or fourth year in a row, so I’m really — I don’t know. I cannot control it,” Jokić said. “Obviously, I think I’m playing the best basketball of my life. So if that’s enough, it’s enough. If not, the guy deserves it. He’s really amazing.”

I mean, he’s got some really, really good assistant coaches, guys who were head coaches, and he’s listening to them, but he’s also implementing his own system. And I want to tell you this—way, way back behind the scenes, he’s calling Stan Van Gundy, because that’s his boy, that’s his guy.

You look at Wemby—he’s 7’5”, shooting one-legged runners from beyond the three-point line. Bol can do that too.

Текст новости: Scotty Pippen: So, this next question is the one I’m most excited to ask. Your dad spells his name S-C-O-T-T-I-E, and you spell your name S-C-O-T-T-Y, but you’re Scotty Pippen Jr. I’m very confused. Please explain what’s going on with the different spellings. To be honest, I’m still kind of confused about it too. It makes no sense. I don’t know why my parents did that. But basically, my dad’s name is with a ‘Y,’ but for some reason, he writes it with an ‘IE’ on everything—except his actual documents. Yeah, but like, he switches it up. Sometimes he’ll go somewhere and write it with a ‘Y.’ Somewhere else, he’ll write it with ‘IE.’ So I don’t know. I feel like I should have probably been with ‘IE’ since he wanted to change his, but yeah. I don’t know why—it’s a little confusing.

Текст новости: Chicago Bulls fans may have noticed something different at the United Center during Monday’s win over the Indiana Pacers — the team’s six championship banners were missing from the rafters. The banners were removed for cleaning following Saturday’s concert featuring Disturbed, Three Days Grace and Sevendust at the arena. The show included theatrics on stage such as pyrotechnics, based on photos and videos of the event posted on social media. All six banners are expected to be returned without issue to the rafters by Thursday’s game, per a team source.

Текст новости: The Pistons run came to an end at the hands of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in 1991 (though they did beat the Celtics in the conference semi-finals), and it is a previous documentary on that Bulls team, The Last Dance, that apparently is the reason Isiah Thomas doesn’t appear in Celtics City. “I decided not to do the Boston documentary because of what Jordan and The Last Dance did,” Thomas told SiriusXM NBA Radio this week. “They totally set me up and blindsided me. And I wasn’t gonna get fooled twice. So I just decided not to participate in the documentary and be able to talk about it. But I wasn’t gonna go on film and sit there and be set up, and potentially be set up again, like I was set up in The Last Dance.”

Текст новости: Just more than a year since acquiring Rep 1 Baseball, Klutch Sports Group is developing ways to find opportunities for its clients on and off the field, using everything from data to fashion. The Los Angeles-based agency is hosting its second annual Klutch Sports House for its MLB athletes based in Arizona for spring training this week. The goal is to bring together dozens of players, agents and others for brand activations, cocktail receptions, curated dinners and more. This year, for the first time, also will feature two live tapings of the digital baseball show “Foul Territory.” It’s one of the many initiatives the agency is taking to boost its baseball division and provide player engagement. Chris Koras, the former COO of Rep 1 Baseball turned head of Klutch Baseball, said the acquisition in December 2023 was necessary for the practice to reach its full potential. “We just reached a place in our business evolution where there were interested parties that came knocking for our baseball and football groups, and it felt appropriate to explore those opportunities,” Koras said. “Klutch answered every question we had. It became clear to me during the process of getting to know [founder] Rich [Paul] and the Klutch team that every part of our service would be elevated.”

Текст новости: Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and the Nuggets got the better of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder in a rematch Monday at Paycom Center, pulling away in the fourth quarter for a 140-127 statement win. It was only Oklahoma City’s third double-digit loss of the season. Jokic amassed 35 points on 15-of-20 shooting, 17 rebounds and eight assists. Murray was the best Canadian on the floor, piling up 34 points and six assists. Denver (42-23) moved back into second place in the West behind Oklahoma City with the victory.

Текст новости: In those first meetings, Knecht wasn’t the same confident person or player. The business of the NBA had just smacked him directly upside the head, a team showing little hesitation to send him out the door only to be forced into welcoming him back because of a failed physical by Williams. At best it was awkward. At worst, it was a problem. As Knecht processed how he’d handle returning to a place where he no longer felt wanted, Morris approached him for a talk. “Be ready. No matter what, be you,” he told Knecht. “When you get the ball, just go be you. And play like how you play, confidently, how you played at Tennessee. “…At the end of the day, just be you. Be ready to shoot. Stay confident. If they wanted the trade, like who gives a f—? Go out there and stay confident.”

Текст новости: After the win, a reporter informed Williams of his new career high, which ignited a smile and a fist pump from the first-year All-Star before he talked about his process for reaching this new career milestone. “A lot of it was not worrying about the officiating, understanding their human; they’re gonna miss calls same way I’m gonna miss shots,” Williams said. “I kind of just let up off of it. It’s just about playing with force, being able to play through contact. I thought I did a good job finishing whether or not I’m getting hit. I think that’s been a big one. I think I’m just getting more and more reps in figuring out how to draw fouls. I think I pumped fake and got somebody in the air today. “I think a lot of it is just playing through contact,” Williams added. “And if I get fouled, I get fouled. And [today] I thought I had a pretty good process of it.”

Текст новости: The Mavericks will likely soon have some pretty challenging decisions to make, because league sources tell me that Anthony Davis and Dereck Lively II (right ankle stress fracture) are indeed both progressing toward an in-season return. Whether those reactivations actually happen, of course, remain to be seen. Davis, I’m told, sampled some 2-on-2 play over the weekend for the first time since the adductor injury sidelined him indefinitely and will almost certainly reach the point before season’s end that playing in an NBA game is feasible. All I heard all weekend is that he’s looking pretty good and I certainly saw a lot of smiles from a seemingly upbeat Davis throughout the afternoon.

Текст новости: Dallas has been repeatedly described as a potential Kevin Durant suitor, before the deadline and since, but I continue to hear that reports of its interest have been overstated. The Mavericks, based on my best read, are not currently planning for a three-star construction. Securing Irving’s future as their backcourt anchor after stunningly surrendering Luka is a priority — Kyrie Irving holds a $44 million player option for next season — and it is likewise obvious that Dallas would have to gut its depth to make a competitive trade offer for Durant.

Текст новости: Herro has also led the Heat in usage in two of the previous three seasons, but this is different with six-time All-Star forward Jimmy Butler no longer available to help stabilize the offense at critical points of the game or shield some of the defensive attention away from Herro. As a result, Herro is averaging career highs in field-goal attempts (18.2 per game), three-point attempts (9.6) and assists (5.8) this season. “Just embracing it,” Herro, 25, said of the challenge that comes with carrying that responsibility on the offensive end. “The challenge I would say is just toggling back and forth with trying to make plays for myself and make plays for my teammates.” Herro’s usage rate spiked to 30.5% in February as the Heat began leaning on Herro even more than usual after trading Butler to the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 6. It marked the first time in Herro’s NBA career that he finished a month with a usage rate over 30%, averaging 24.1 points and seven assists per game while shooting 41.1% from the field and 25.9% on threes in February. “That’s always been my thing,” Herro continued. “When I have the ball in my hands a lot, not trying to shoot too much. But just taking the right shots and also balancing being aggressive for myself and balancing getting opportunities for my teammates.”

Текст новости: Herro knows higher usage usually leads to lower efficiency, but he also doesn’t want to just accept that as his reality. “It’s tough,” Herro said. “This season, I was trying to shoot 50% from the field. Obviously, it’s come down. I was like high 40s for a minute. So just trying to keep it up there, trying to get it back to 47, 48 by the end of the season. “But it is tougher taking a lot of end-of-the-shot-clock shots. And then end-of-the-quarter shots, I take a lot of those. Then I have guys draped all over me throughout the game. So it’s not easy, but just trying to continue to find ways of getting to the line, drawing fouls, being aggressive to make my teammates get open shots. So just trying to continue to work through it.”

Like everything,” Poole, who was traded to the Wizards on July 2, 2023, after four seasons with Golden State, told Andscape. “Practice, travel, games, players. But the [opposing] players know me now. The [opposing] coaches definitely know me because the way I’m seeing coverages throughout the course of the game, they’re very aware of me. “New environment, new situation. It’s only a matter of time before we put ourselves in that situation too, to be at the biggest stage as well. It’s what we’re grinding for.”

It took a little bit. But shout out to coach BK [Keefe] because he trusts me and he put me in a position where I could thrive. We talked about that as soon as he became coach.

He told me that last year as soon as he took over the head coaching job. But it just took about a half a season or so with a new team, a new organization to kind get that figured out.

And it’s also making my other guys better because I’m putting confidence into them, letting them know I’m trusting them to make shots, to make plays, go play a game. I’m going to do my best to be aggressive. Me doing that is putting you in a position to be successful. We got a nice little vibe.

Текст новости: As he sat by his locker, New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns spoke in a thoughtful, albeit somber, tone. The Knicks had just labored through an eventual loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. That development reinforced the challenge New York faced in its first game without All-Star point guard Jalen Brunson, whom the Knicks said will be sidelined for at least the next two weeks after spraining his right ankle.

Текст новости: The reasons for Towns’ subdued demeanor went beyond New York’s initial struggles with mitigating Brunson’s absence, though. It also stemmed from more important reasons. Towns just rejoined the Knicks after taking a team-approved leave of absence to support his girlfriend, Jordyn Woods, and her family after losing a close friend to cancer. “Obviously, it’s been a very tough week, especially for a week at a place where I’m usually comfortable at in the summer,” said Towns, who has a home in Los Angeles. “It meant a lot to have my teammates supporting me and understanding the situation, and to have the love of my family and then my girl’s family through this hard time.”

I know the feeling. So having to open up my old wounds to help them and support them through this process is a lot, and I wish it’s something that no one goes through.”

Текст новости: The Los Angeles Lakers’ eight-game winning streak was snapped on Saturday night to their historic rivals the Boston Celtics. Adding insult to injury, LeBron James exited late in the fourth quarter with a groin strain. Unfortunately, this came at a poor time as L.A. embarks on a daunting March schedule. The purple and gold now have six games in eight nights, with four being against playoff-caliber teams. With seeding becoming more important as the regular season winds down, staying at the second seed is a tall ask with James out. However, Austin Reaves hopes the 40-year-old is back sooner rather than later to keep the good times rolling, via Spectrum Sportsnet: “I mean, you never want to see one of your brothers have to leave the game due to injury. Whatever the case may be, like JJ said, we don’t know exactly what it is but obviously like I said, you never want to see anybody go out. He’s a huge part of what we do so hopefully we get some good news and he gets back quick.”

Reaves can pick up the slack as well, knowing they will all need to contribute in James’ absence: “It’s a next man up mentality. Like you said, we’ve had many situations where a player deals with some type of injury or a new trade or whatever it is, and we’ve done a really good job of bouncing back. And I don’t expect anything else. Like I said, it’s a next man up mentality and not one person is gonna do what Bron does for us. But you can do it as a collective and like I said, hopefully he gets back on the court soon.”

Since 2012-13, when he got his ankle problems under control and first made the playoffs, he’s made 4.4 3-pointers per game — 34% more than second-place Klay Thompson’s 3.3. It’s not just that Curry takes more 3s than anyone else. He also makes them at a ridiculous rate. Out of 198 players with at least 2,500 career 3-point attempts, Curry ranks third in accuracy (42.4%, behind Kyle Korver and Steve Nash).

Текст новости: Curry is still an All-Star putting up stellar numbers, and he signed a new contract extension last summer that runs through the 2026-27 season. Ultimately, 4,000 might be a mere way station. We can estimate how high Curry could climb using the “favorite toy” model, which Bill James originally developed for baseball stats and John Hollinger later modified for NBA usage. It estimates a player’s career total in a particular statistic, based on his recent track record, age and height (because wing-sized players tend to have longer careers than very short or tall players).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: For instance, let’s look at 4,500 career 3s, which Curry should accomplish with two more good seasons. The model gives him a 96% chance to reach that milestone, which is an astonishing 51% higher than Allen’s career total. Let’s dream higher. Curry became the first player to reach 3,000 and now 4,000 3s. Why not 5,000? That’s tougher but eminently doable, as the model gives Curry a 39% shot to reach 5,000 career 3s. He even has a 6% chance to reach 5,533 career triples — as many as Allen and Miller combined.

Текст новости: Overall, the model estimates that Curry will retire with 4,893 total 3s. But that’s only the average projected outcome, which means there’s a 50% chance he exceeds that already lofty total. After all, LeBron James is presently defying all conceivable aging curves, and Curry could fit a similar profile.

Now, don’t get it twisted—Bron’s the best overall player you could want as a superstar. Physically gifted, can do everything on the court. But my GOAT?

So, when they took the cookies? Man… he was pissed. Like, really pissed. And that’s when we all kind of looked at each other like, ‘Oh… this might be it. He’s gone after this season.’ I swear, I don’t ever wanna see that man mad like that again. You better get out of his way if he ain’t got his cookies.

It’s not about that. It’s things that are going on that are not cool—let’s just call it what it is. Like the load management thing. I said 15 years ago: If we’re going to load manage, load manage in practice. Let these dudes play. We don’t want to see—if we buy tickets months in advance—that they’re not playing. The game looks the same, Channing. It’s plug-and-play in most places. 90% of the league looks the same, so the creativity is kind of gone. I’m not knocking the players, but as we all know, it’s a copycat league. So with that, there’s going to be, ‘Oh, if they’re successful doing it, we’re going to try to copy.’

Текст новости: It wasn’t a conversation that lasted very long, and it took even less convincing. Coming over in the three-team trade that sent Zach LaVine to Sacramento, the new Zach in town – Collins – had a quick sit-down with Bulls coach Billy Donovan. The topic? A request for the 6-foot-11, 250-pounder to help out in the physicality department, to give the Bulls some muscle behind the hustle. Collins’ immediate reaction was yes and yes.

Текст новости: “They definitely told me that they like my physicality and what I bring as a big guy, the five man, and they needed that,” Collins said. “Every team needs that. You see around the league, no matter how skilled you are, no matter how you shoot the ball, there’s a level of physicality and dawg in a lot of those teams that win championships. I think it’s a recipe for success.” Then he smirked. “Yeah, they definitely told me that was what they were looking for and I told them, ‘I can oblige for sure.’ “

Текст новости: In that time Collins averaged 16 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists, while sitting at a plus-54. Not bad for a guy that didn’t play in his first game after the Bulls added him, Kevin Huerter and Tre Jones in the trade, and wasn’t sure how or when he was going to get on the floor. “It’s always tough not playing,” Collins said. “But I wasn’t too worried about it. A lot of things happen in an NBA season. Guys get sick, guys get hurt, guys can’t play, and you never know when your number is going to be called. “I knew there was a good opportunity here, especially with the way they play, that I could fit in and show them what I could do, whether it was practice or a game, shootaround, whatever, I knew my time would come.”

Текст новости: The Heat has now wasted a fourth-quarter lead in seven of its last eight losses and in a total of 14 losses this season. Only the Minnesota Timberwolves entered Sunday with more blown fourth-quarter leads (16 blown fourth-quarter leads) than the Heat this season. The Heat has also blown a double-digit lead in 16 losses this season, which is the second-most such collapses in the NBA this season behind only the Utah Jazz (17 blown double-digit leads).

But just continuing to stick with it.” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra took part of the blame for Saturday’s fourth-quarter issues, expressing regret for some of his rotation decisions in the loss.

Текст новости: As injuries hamper the Dallas Mavericks, two-way contract guard Brandon Williams faces a prime opportunity to seize the moment. He did precisely that against the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night, finishing with a career-high 31 points, adding five rebounds, and six assists. With Klay Thompson as the only available regular starter for the Mavericks, Williams had to fill a backcourt void left by the Luka Doncic trade, along with injuries to Kyrie Irving and Jaden Hardy. Outside of backcourt injuries, Dallas missed a lot of talent, but Williams focused on taking advantage of the attention the teammates around him commanded. “I just took what the defense gave,” Williams explained. “Ultimately, they were looking at the other guys that we had, respectfully. Klay draws a lot of gravity, as well as many other guys on our team. Just feeding off of that and just taking what defense gives.”

Текст новости: With Williams solidified as a consistent catch-and-shoot threat, a talented creator in the paint, and a steady decision-maker when initiating the offense, he has a well-rounded offensive skill-set that makes him a value add. Despite being undersized for a guard, his defensive competitiveness is also apparent. “B Will is tough, bro,” said Naji Marshall, who finished with a career-high 29 points and 17 rebounds against Memphis. “He can do his thing. Sometimes, somebody just needed an opportunity, and they gave it to him and went out there and took advantage.

Текст новости: A frequent matchup for Williams involved his close friend Ja Morant, who delivered 31 points and eight assists. Morant isn’t surprised by what he saw from Williams and is confident he will get the NBA opportunity he’s worked to earn since going undrafted out of Arizona in 2021. “I’ve known [Brandon Williams] for a while, so I definitely feel like he’s going to get his opportunity when it’s time for him,” Morant told Sportskeeda. “He’s just got to continue to keep working and keep producing how he did tonight with guys out for them. This is the opportunity you get, and it can go a long way. He just needs to continue to take advantage of the opportunity he’s got right now, and I think he’ll be fine.”

When asked to compare Saturday’s injury to that one, James replied: “No, it’s not as bad as that. It’s not as bad as that.” He then turned around and rapped his knuckles on the wooden locker behind him to not jinx himself with his prognosis.

Текст новости: Stephen Curry became the 26th player in NBA history to score 25,000 career points, reaching the milestone during the third quarter of the Golden State Warriors’ 115-110 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday night. “BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!” Curry yelled while running through the hallway to the locker room after a quick return to the court postgame. And that was a tribute to teammate Draymond Green, who loves to yell “boom” after making a 3-pointer. Green, who hit the go-ahead 3 with 35 seconds left, secured the game ball for Curry. “He’s going to keep it for me. I heard he has a little bit of KD’s memorabilia,” Curry said about former teammate Kevin Durant.

Текст новости: Curry, who turns 37 next Friday, surpassed 25,000 with a 3-pointer at 8:32 of the third quarter, then received a warm ovation when he was recognized during a timeout with 5:42 to go. He finished with 32 points — pushing his total to 25,017 — on 8-for-22 shooting and converted all 12 of his free throws as the Warriors moved to 11-1 with Jimmy Butler in the lineup this season. Curry, who hit the mark in his 1,011th game, said he wasn’t keeping track of his totals. “It was a surprise, actually. I knew I was coming up on it but I didn’t think about it until I heard it in game,” he said. “There’s a list, [broadcaster] Tim Roye told me after the game only 10 guys I think or now 10 guys that have done it with one franchise, so that’s pretty special. And the names that are on that list are synonymous with basketball history, so that’s pretty cool.”

All-star point guard  Damian Lillard got to a big step-back, fall away, 25-foot three-pointer over an outstretched Magic defender to win the game, but the shot was wayward at the buzzer. “Once I got into that space I made my mind up I was going to go for the win,” he said. “I got space, I just lost my balance a little bit. I think I got too deep, deeper than I wanted to. I just was trying to get him going downhill and then get back behind the line but when I got back behind the line I kind of was fighting against my body more than I would’ve liked to and I just got off balance.

Jet lagged after a 12-hour flight to Tahiti, Williams didn’t have a signal on his phone while riding the Bora Bora Navette from the airport to the main island. When he finally connected to Wi-Fi, thousands of text messages and social media alerts said the same thing. Just off the coast of paradise, during a family vacation, Williams learned he was traded. Zach Kleiman, the Grizzlies’ general manager, called Williams and thanked him for his service. He knew it was coming. But still. “I never experienced anything like that,” Williams said. “I felt numb. There was so much going on. When I’m overwhelmed, I just get away from everything…I threw my phone to the side and let it be.”

Текст новости: A change in scenery, a no-nonsense head coach, and a renewed belief in self, have sparked a career season for Williams at both ends of the court. He’s playing more minutes, scoring more points, and grabbing more rebounds than ever before. His offensive rating is the best he’s had since his rookie season. And he leads the Nets in deflections, proof that he’s embraced his defensive-minded role. “I’m not in his mind, but we all go through ups and downs,” Fernandez said. “All you can do is support a player at the end of the day. He’s the one who has to gain that confidence back… I don’t care if you score more or less. What I care about is your intentions and if you’re trying to do what we’re asking you to do. Then if the ball goes in or not, we really can’t control that, and so far he’s done a great job.”

Текст новости: Woj noted that his daily routine hasn’t changed much. “I’m probably on my phone just as much, but now I’m having different conversations. In some ways, my job hasn’t slowed down because there’s a lot of work in this role—it’s a new job with new challenges and learning experiences. But many of the skills and relationships I built at ESPN carry over here. I spent the last 30 years talking daily with coaches, players, and agents, and that remains the same. I still talk to all those people, just in a different way. Gathering information is a big part of this job—understanding the players you want to recruit, learning everything about them, and ensuring the right fit between them and our program.”

Текст новости: Atlanta Hawks head coach Quin Snyder has had the chance to coach some amazing international players throughout his career, but more specifically, those from France. This year, he’s been given the opportunity to coach the No. 1 overall pick, Zaccaharie Risacher, and throughout the season, he’s shown him nothing but love when talking about his growth. For Snyder, he thinks that all of the French players in the league are special, and he spoke about it before their game against the Indiana Pacers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: “There’s a number of French players in the NBA right now – younger players – that are very talented and competitive, and you can see their progression and see how their career is going to have that arc,” Snyder said. “We have one of them on our team in Zacch. Like I’ve said before, his competitiveness is unique, especially for his age. Rudy [Gobert] had that level of fight in him. Rudy was incredibly competitive. anybody that watches Rudy and Zacch play, they’re different players, but they’re very unique.” Snyder coached Gobert when he was on the Utah Jazz, and he watched him turn into a Defensive Player of the Year. He also was able to coach Boris Diaw, who was known as a “do it all” type of player when he was in the league.

Текст новости: “I don’t think I coached a player that passed the ball better than Boris Diaw. Just his feel for the game,” Snyder said. Snyder has echoed the same sentiments about Risacher’s growth through the season, and it looks like he’s starting to figure things out more and more as the year winds down. “I think with Zacch we’ve seen not just flashes, but periods of time where [he’s growing]. I’ve mentioned this about his success not being linear where he has opportunities in games where he does something, and you’re like, ‘Okay.’ For me, things I’ve seen him working on, sometimes for people who are just watching, that’s a flash that they haven’t seen the work that’s been put in,” Snyder said.

Текст новости: When the former 15-year NBA veteran was hired by L.A., opinions formed early regarding potential success in his first season. No one could envision what had transpired, but Redick exceeded expectations, leading to comparisons to Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay, who also came to L.A. as a young, innovative mind. Naturally, comparisons are being made of Redick to McVay and the Lakers coach talked about their relationship thus far, revealing they had conversations before the former got into coaching. “First of all comparisons is the thief of joy and I love Sean,” Redick said.

Текст новости: Asked whether he would ever consider playing in the EuroLeague, McCollum appeared positive, but on one condition: that his family approves of the move overseas. “Absolutely. I would love to play in Europe at some point,” he affirmed. “And I had dreamsl, goals and ambitions to play with my brother in Europe one day. He’s 37. I’m 33. I have things to do here.” “Family dynamics also play a role,” he admitted. “I have kids, I’m married, my kids are growing up. My wife is a dentist. We have all these things that affect our lives and decisions but, if all things were as they should be, I would love the opportunity to do it. I just don’t know where I am at the moment in terms of life,” he stressed.

Текст новости: However, Jovan Buha of The Athletic has raised doubts, suggesting that the buzz around the LA Lakers’ interest in Phoenix Suns superstar may just be a tactic to generate clicks. “I have not heard anything about the Lakers being interested in Kevin Durant,” Buha said on his latest podcast. “I think that might just be a situation where someone throws the Lakers out there to get some buzz with it. “For the Lakers, a hypothetical trade for KD would have to be something like Austin [Reaves], Rui [Hachimura], Dalton [Knecht], Gabe [Vincent], Maxi [Kleber], a pick, and a couple pick swaps. That’s a lot,” he added. “The Lakers are basically giving up everything that they could trade. For KD, you can make that case, but if you’re Phoenix, if you have an open bidding with at least multiple teams, you can get more than that.”

Grimes dismissed the team’s concerns about Dončić’s conditioning and work habits, saying his former teammate was always in the gym whenever he would show up for his late-night shooting sessions or practice-day weightlifting. “It’s just a narrative around him. Once a narrative gets thrown out there, everybody just runs with it,” Grimes said. “Whatever they’re saying, if he’s 270 (pounds) and he gets to the finals, let him be 270 then. It’s crazy.”

Fox’s performance in his first game back in Sacramento since the Kings traded him in early February mirrored the unevenness of the fans’ reaction to him in San Antonio’s 127-109 loss. “I haven’t made a shot in two weeks, man,” Fox said. “When you change teams, at some point you’re going to play the [former] team. I think it was good. I wouldn’t really say I got emotional. But [the tribute] was great. I was here for so long, almost a decade. So, I really do appreciate it.”

Текст новости: Adebayo, 27, enters Friday night’s matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves at Kaseya Center with 4,864 rebounds since being drafted by the Heat in 2017. That puts Adebayo just 927 rebounds behind Haslem’s franchise record of 5,791 rebounds in a Heat uniform. “When I was playing, every time I got one rebound, I used to look at him and say: ‘That’s another record,’” said Haslem, who retired after 20 NBA seasons at the end of the 2022-2023 season. “So he has definitely been letting me know that he’s creeping up, that he’s going to catch me. But my response is, ‘Not this year.’” Haslem is right. Adebayo won’t break Haslem’s record this year.

Текст новости: So, will watching Adebayo become the Heat’s all-time leading rebounder one day be bittersweet for Haslem? “The bitter part, not really,” Haslem said. “Like I said, I’m very prideful. But it’s Bam. He’s somebody I’ve taken a liking to and I’ve created a relationship with outside of the game of basketball. I know his mom, I know his family. We spend a lot of time together just talking about life and the kind of man that he wants to be and the kind of man that I think he can be and should be, along with the basketball player that I think he’s capable of being. So for me, it would be one thing if it was somebody who I didn’t have a relationship with. But it’s almost like a nephew or a son or a younger brother. So it will still feel like it’s in the family. He’s cut from the same cloth as me.”

Текст новости: According to ESPN BET, Gilgeous-Alexander is -700 to win MVP while Jokic is +400. Those are “done deal” odds, with SGA as the runway favorite to win. Odds of -700 mean that one would have to bet seven units to win one. There is no upside to making a bet with odds that short, with little return on investment for a bet that won’t be paid out for almost two months. Meanwhile, +400 is great value for a player with a legitimate chance to win.

But Jokic ranks first in the NBA in both (+362.7 offensive Net Points, +423.4 overall Net Points). A different way of estimating player impact is with the family of plus/minus stats that track how a team does with a player on the court versus how they do with him off. According to basketball-reference.com, the Thunder are 15.8 points better per 100 possessions with SGA on the court than when he is on the bench. An elite mark. But again, Jokic is better. The Nuggets are a full 20.0 points better per 100 possessions with Jokic on the court than when he is on the bench, and when he is on the bench the Thunder are outscored by 8.6 points per 100 possessions.

That takes sheer confidence.  “I definitely wanted to be considered in the conversation for one of the best players off the bench,” he tells us after shootaround one day. “I mean, obviously, with our team [and] the way we’re built, we are very talented. And our starting five, obviously it’s a lot of big names. So I felt like for myself to make a jump and be considered one of the best bench players in the League, that would only help our team.

Defensively, being more active.”  At just 6-1, Pritchard is crashing the boards and averaging 3.8 trb and 1.4 offensive boards. “It really just comes down to confidence, honestly,” Pritchard says, when asked what’s been the difference maker for him this season. “I’ve just been confident every time I step on the floor. That’s what I’m capable of doing, and I’m capable of helping [us] win at the highest of levels.”

Being employed by a television partner of the league, he felt obligated to try and enhance the broadcast with information and perspectives that would supplement the game. A few months later though, he decided to leave TNT Sports and become a media free agent ahead of an exciting season of basketball. “My contract was up and others’ contracts were up, and I felt it was a good time to leave that point,” Haynes said. “Obviously we were kind of shocked that TNT didn’t get to retain the NBA rights, and so once it became clear that they were not, there was a decision to be made.”

Can’t repeat the words because they ain’t suited for FCC airwaves, that’s what he was doing. I thought long and hard about this over the last few hours because I had no intentions, Molly, of talking about this at all, and the reason why is because it was a one-on-one… I wouldn’t say a conversation, but it was a one-on-one confrontation. But then I woke up and everybody from ESPN, my agent, and everybody else were telling me that this thing had gone viral and so ultimately it was unavoidable and that is why I have to discuss it now. That wasn’t a basketball player confronting me, that was a parent, that was a father and I can’t sit here and be angry or feel slighted by LeBron James in any way in that regard. By all accounts he’s obviously a wonderful family man and a wonderful father who cares very deeply about his son and based on some of the comments that he had heard or shall I say I think he thought he heard, he clearly took exception to some of the things that he heard me say and he confronted me about it. For the record, his agent and friend Rich Paul has my number, Maverick Carter who works on him has my number, LeBron James knows how to get in contact if he wants to. He never called, because he wanted to talk to me I would have accepted that call had he wanted to see me I would have flown out and I would have seen him and I would have had a conversation man-to-man but that is not what he elected to do. Instead, he elected to confront me while I was sitting courtside.’

A former Mr. New York Basketball winner, West Virginia recruit and St. Bonaventure standout, Relph turned his attention to molding current and future pros after his career was over. Since 2009, he’s worked with over 10,000 players at all levels, including household-name NBA and WNBA clientele. He instructs at private sessions and also has his own gym at the Tyler Relph Basketball Lab in Addison, Texas, which opened in Oct. 2020. Relph’s methods are careful and detailed — and equally as intense. Since Coulibaly is just 20 years old, he doesn’t hold back.

Текст новости: Washington, by far, leads the NBA in rookie minutes played (4,446) and employed its youngest starting five since 1970 on Oct. 30, 2024. Though they’re not a winning team by any stretch of the imagination, the franchise is fostering an environment where maturation can happen organically. “I think for any player, development is a process of are you in a position where you can learn from your mistakes and make mistakes,” Relph said. “You can’t be afraid to make mistakes, especially if you’re in a developmental process. He’s still young. He’s still in that developmental stage. He’s not a 30-year-old vet where it’s like, ‘Hey man, you can’t make these mistakes. If you make any of these mistakes, we’ve got to take you out.’ “So I think it’s very beneficial for him where he’s at. I think Washington’s done a great job as far as his development and understanding him as a player. Their organization deserves a lot of credit for what they’re doing.”

Being around longtime national team vets has left an imprint on Coulibaly and the next generation, especially Nicolas Batum. “He talked to me a lot this summer,” Coulibaly said. “Whenever we were eating, in the locker room, playing or not playing, he was always talking to me. And showing it on the court, he was playing the hardest. He plays so hard, it’s actually impressive.”

Текст новости: League sources said Sabonis, who has three more seasons and a combined $140.3 million left on his current deal, is expected to seek clarity about the organization’s plan in the offseason. Just as Fox wanted to know whose voice mattered most on key decisions, and who the team’s owner might be trusting the most as counsel, Sabonis is known to have similar questions. Even with the recent success, league sources said several members of the team’s core are watching and wondering where this is all headed. “What is the vision here?” one league source close to a core Kings player said. “It feels like it could be headed toward chaos.”

Текст новости: Whatever plans were on the whiteboard, though, have been derailed by Irving’s injury. With his availability for next season uncertain, the Mavs’ summer plans could perhaps shift to, incredibly, their own draft pick. “When you have a setback like they’ve suffered, you have to identify what you can control and focus on improvement there,” a league executive said. “They don’t control their first-round pick from 2027 to 2030, and this is a good draft.”

Текст новости: What’s clear, especially after Harrison’s statement about Irving in the wake of his season-ending injury, is that Dallas isn’t turning away from its new roster. “They’re doubling down,” a league executive said. Another exec predicted Irving will opt out of his contract this summer and sign a longer-term deal for a number starting below his $44 million player option to give the Mavericks some wiggle room below the first apron. With Irving also expected to miss a large part of the 2025-26 season, Harrison will need to add reinforcements.

Текст новости: Fox insists he “never asked for a trade,” from the franchise that drafted him fifth in 2017. “I loved it,” he said of Sacramento. “Everybody bled purple. It was always great just going to the grocery store, going out to a restaurant. Everybody there was extremely kind. And when we started winning, then it was ‘light the beam’ everywhere. You really felt it around the city. So, it was definitely a great place to be for as long as I was.”

Текст новости: So Rich Paul, according to league sources, informed Doug Christie that the path ahead remained unchanged. If anything, Fox was only firmer in the belief that his prime seasons were better spent elsewhere. This wasn’t a trade request, but a transparent assessment of the state of the franchise and a confirmation that the time had come for both sides to plot an exit. That conversation, league sources said, set in motion the official end of Fox’s tenure, as Christie ran the messaging up the ladder.

Текст новости: Fox, who was set in 2025-26 to enter the final year of his five-year contract, had warned the organization this summer that he was tiring of all the turnover at the head coaching position and declined to sign an extension during the offseason. So when the Kings fired Brown, Fox felt that his time in Sacramento had come to an end, too. “I was like, ‘Yo, I’ve been here for going on my eighth year. If Mike gets fired, I’ll be going on my fifth coach,'” Fox told ESPN. “And I told them, ‘I’m not going to play for another coach. I’m going to play for another team.'”

Текст новости: Fox, who says he still talks to Brown every week, even had to dispel rumors about tension with his former coach among the Spurs’ staffers upon arriving in San Antonio. What bothered Fox most is that although Sacramento released a statement addressing Brown’s firing, the organization didn’t discuss the move publicly with reporters until 40 days later, after the guard had already been traded. “You fire the coach, and you don’t do an interview?” Fox said. “So, all the blame was on me. Did it weigh on me? No. I don’t give a f—. But the fact y’all are supposed to be protecting your player and y’all let that happen. … I felt at the time the organization didn’t have my back.”

The organization still holds Fox in high regard for all of his contributions to the franchise and the city, the source said.

Текст новости: The Bucknell product rattled home a game-winning 3 to deliver a 116-115 Thunder victory that pushed the winners high enough in the standings to cause them to forfeit their 2020 first-rounder to the Sixers. If Muscala’s shot didn’t drop — if the pick didn’t convey — Philadelphia would have received Oklahoma City’s second-round picks in 2022 and 2023 instead. Which would have had Maxey lofting his signature floaters somewhere else. “I’m well aware,” Muscala told me last spring.

Текст новости: There’s been no escaping it ever since. When Muscala officially announced his retirement last July, Philadelphia’s official social channels shared a wry appreciation post. A Sixers security staffer, meanwhile, is fond of reminding Maxey of his shared history with Muscala once or twice a month. No wonder Maxey sought Muscala out on the floor during pregame warmups to pay homage when the Sixers played the Thunder last season. “I was messing with him,” Maxey recalled, “[saying] ‘you’re the reason why I’m here!’ ” Muscala chuckles at the memory and can only marvel at the star Maxey has become. “He’s obviously a very good player,” Muscala conferred.

Текст новости: Durant says the key to his longevity has been “the recovery stuff.” “I’m keeping my body loose and flexible,” Durant said. “Icing. Doing stuff you didn’t do at 20 and 22 because you can just get up and go. I warm up before I get out on the court. I do exercises before I do anything, which is the new norm for me. It’s been cool getting to know your body and your game as you get older… “I feel like I’m in my 30s. Somedays you get out of the bed and you feel a little something. But my energy is still there. I feel good. I still feel like I can go out there and play 48 minutes and play efficient basketball. I feel great.”

Joining Ryan Dunn in the stands was Kevin Durant, a perennial NBA All-Star that he also now views as a mentor and big brother. “Kevin coming to my brother’s game meant a lot,” Dunn told Andscape. “It shows how much he supports not only me, but my family. And it’s a good relationship that we have that he’s able to come and support one of my family members and with what he has going on. We’re all professional athletes and for [Durant] to be able to come see Justin’s game and be able to talk after was great and very cool.”

Текст новости: While no final decision has been made on Christie’s future, team sources said a continuation of this current trend would give him a strong chance at landing a new deal in the summer. If the Kings decide to open up another coaching search in the offseason, however, they would be hiring their 14th coach since the Rick Adelman era ended in 2006.

Текст новости: “During Mike’s extension talks, some guys in the locker room didn’t want Mike,” Fox said. “Some guys wanted him to be fired during the summer. … But I’m not going to say [who].” Brown signed his new deal, but the Kings started this season with losses to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Then, they dropped eight of 12 games leading into Brown’s Dec. 27 firing 31 games into the season. At the time of Brown’s termination, the Kings had lost an NBA-worst nine contests after leading in the fourth quarter and were reeling from a five-game skid.

Текст новости: During Brown’s extension talks, the organization’s waffling on the coach’s future had reached Fox. Per league and team sources, the front office asked for his opinion. Fox, who had four coaches in his first seven seasons, was clear: He was a strong supporter of Brown’s and had no interest in another coaching change. Fox had been asking for a structured environment with a level of accountability for years. It felt, to him, like they were building it. After Brown was extended, Fox reiterated the stance publicly: “Just having that stability helps in the long run, I feel like,” he said.

Текст новости: I just assumed all along that their interest would remain in the offseason when the Suns circle back to Durant trades. Do you think the Kyrie injury impacts those plans at all? How do you see Dallas’s pursuit of Kevin?”* Tim MacMahon: *”Yeah, and it’s funny—I’ve been told by people up high in the Mavs front office, ‘No, no, we’re not a KD team.’ And there are times where you’re told stuff, and you’re like, ‘I don’t believe you.’ And I would definitely put that in that category. Look, the Kyrie thing is a devastating blow because it obviously just kills any hopes this season and significantly impacts next season. But by Nico Harrison’s own words, when they made this trade, they put themselves in position to have a three-to-four-year time frame. You’ve got to do everything. The only way you can possibly justify this trade is to win a title in those three to four years. So, you’ve got to do everything possible.

Текст новости: Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green sent well wishes to New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns after the death of a family friend, but said Thursday he was just relaying what he heard when he said on his podcast that Towns didn’t play for the Knicks against Golden State this week because Jimmy Butler was in the building. Towns was listed out for personal reasons when the Warriors beat the Knicks 114-102 on Tuesday. Green, during his podcast with former NBA player Baron Davis, said that “some would say he didn’t play because Jimmy was in the building.”

Текст новости: Green was not aware of that until after the Warriors’ 121-119 win over Brooklyn on Thursday. “That’s unfortunate, I’m sorry to hear that. That sucks,” Green said. “But my comments that I made were, you know, ‘People, what I heard was this.’ That’s what I heard. So I do send my well wishes to him and his family. “It’s inevitable, we all experience death in one way or another, and we’ll all experience it in the same way one day. So it’s unfortunate, you never wish that on anybody, but ‘The Draymond Green Show with Baron Davis’ must go on.”

He definitely gets under people’s skin and a lot of people can’t play and talk trash at the same time. He got a few guys deep there.”

Текст новости: In a continuation of criticism of the league office over the better part of two years, New York Knicks owner James Dolan called for a resolution to be voted on at this month’s NBA board of governors meetings that asks for clearer accounting of the league’s finances, according to a letter received this week by the league office and the board of governors. Dolan, who said ahead of the September meeting that he wouldn’t be voting on the 2024-25 budget, nor the election of a new chair of the board of governors, laid out in the letter, which was obtained by ESPN, why he believes the NBA needs to add a resolution to its agenda for this month’s meeting as part of an ongoing attempt to seek out “increased financial transparency and operating efficiency.”

My job is to give my opinion. Haven’t you been hearing me talk about the Oklahoma City Thunder and how I have them picked to win the West? It’s on my Twitter timeline. I said it on record.” Perkins, a former NBA champion turned outspoken analyst, didn’t shy away from defending himself and his role at ESPN. “I’m not Producer Perk, I’m not Executive Producer Perk. I do my job as an analyst and I go home,” he continued. “If they ask me how I feel about the Lakers or the Warriors, I talk about it and I weigh in. That’s literally my job. You want some smoke?

At first, I didn’t want to do the movie, but my agent made me. So, I decided to do it and had to go to Vancouver for about a month and a half. While I was in Vancouver doing the movie, out of everybody who thought they would get traded, everybody thought I was the one who was untouchable—like on some Luka [__]—you know what I’m saying? They thought I was the one who couldn’t be traded. But then, my agent called and told me I got traded. Cleveland had to come to Vancouver and take me through the physical for me to go to Cleveland. So now, I had just gotten traded to the worst team in the NBA. When I got there, we won 17 out of 82 games that year.

My mom gave me a bank card, and she was like, ‘You put this code in, you can get $300 out a day.’ “So basically, every day or every other day, if I needed some cash, I’d go and get $300 out of the ATM. Any other money I spent, I swiped on the card. “I didn’t go into a bank until like my third year—until I got to Cleveland and realized, like, damn, I got like $800,000 in that bit.

We get to camp, and we’re staying in a Holiday Inn or a Days Inn—some spot like that. It wasn’t even the type of hotel we normally stayed in, but it was a small town, so I understood. But then they tell us, “We gotta share rooms.” I looked at Z-Bo like, “Hold up. So I gotta sit in a room with another dude, smelling his funk? What if I want to be on the phone with my old lady? I can’t talk to my old lady?” Me and Z-Bo took offense to that. I was like, “Bro, I got a black card in my wallet. Man, this is crazy!” So me and Z-Bo got our own rooms. Next thing you know, we go to the team meeting, and the first thing Nate McMillan says is, “Who in here got their own room?” Only ones were me and Z-Bo. He looked at us and said, “Y’all can get the f*** up out of here.” So me and Z-Bo just walked out! We went to TGI Fridays and got something to eat.

Now if you’re talking about guys who can score the basketball? Grant Hill can score the basketball, he wasn’t a great passer. He could score the basketball. Tracy McGrady was a great passer and he could score. So, you can group those guys in whatever opinion that you have, none of them are going to be right and none of them are going to be wrong, they are all great players.”

But the [3-point] volume isn’t enough to beat the Clevelands and the Bostons.

(For the season, the Knicks have allowed the fifth-fewest 3-point tries in the league.) But a plain look at the numbers against the primary contenders — 53% of Boston’s shots against the Knicks this season have been from deep, while Cleveland checks in at 42% — would suggest New York has plenty of schematic work to do against the cream of the crop.

The Cleveland Cavaliers have won 12 straight games. Oklahoma City got the MVP and they are on fire. Y’all are talking about who’s in second place. That’s the reason I get pissed. Hey, the Lakers are doing great. I don’t mind being wrong. The Warriors are doing great.

I don’t really care,” Westbrook said after Denver’s 116-110 win over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday. “It’s the reason why they’ve got five people in the paint.

Текст новости: But the Sun Devils had something those other programs lacked: a high-six-figure donation from NBA superstar James Harden to his alma mater’s Sun Angel collective, Front Office Sports has learned. Harden’s two-year college career came well before college athletes could legally earn money for their NIL (name, image, and likeness), but now he’s involved in helping his school compete with the big boys for top talent. Adding Quaintance helped the Sun Devils sign a top-10 recruiting class heading into this season.

Текст новости: But despite how far their money could go in the NIL world, many of Harden’s peers in the NBA aren’t interested. At least not right now. One theory: A general manager of a Power 4 team told FOS his program’s NBA alums are “too bitter” over missing out on their own NIL money. He’s given up on trying to get them to donate to their collective. (Even Harden admits that he can’t imagine his career if he had made significant money as an undergraduate. “I would have wanted NIL, but if I was getting six figures in college, I don’t even know where I would be,” he said to FOS. “The hunger wouldn’t probably be there.“)

Though NBA players can become extremely wealthy—Harden has earned $372 million from his contracts to date—many say they don’t want to throw their hard-earned money away on something unpredictable like college athlete performance. One NBA All-Star requested anonymity to speak candidly about the NIL market. He’s given back to his school throughout his career but never to NIL. “You want me to pay $250,000 just to get a guy to come play for my school?” he told FOS. “And then I have to watch them potentially average five points per game and come off the bench? The market for this stuff is crazy.”

Текст новости: On Wednesday evening, the Denver Nuggets continued their winning ways with a come from behind home victory over the Sacramento Kings. A large part of the reason why the Nuggets were able to get the win was the play of Russell Westbrook, who poured in 25 points to go along with five rebounds and three assists on the evening. Westbrook has been enjoying somewhat of a career resurgence this year with Denver, and after the game Wednesday, Nuggets guard Jamal Murray spoke on the former MVP’s impact in the Mile High City. “I don’t know how much Russ notices, but he’s got a lot of guys on the team that watch him, study him, and appreciate everything he’s done in this league,” said Murray, per DNVR Nuggets on X, formerly Twitter.

Текст новости: There is so much that goes into a perfect assist. It’s about timing and vision, sure, but really it’s an act of faith, an offer of trust in the teammates whose habits you know so intimately the ball starts to travel to where they’re headed before they even quite know they’re going there. Trae Young knows how to deliver a perfect assist. In fact, for all Chris Paul’s razzle and Nikola Jokic’s dazzle, it’s Young who’s having an exceptional season in this regard, so definitively topping the NBA’s assist chart he should probably have his own page. He’s crossed the 20-assist mark multiple times and spent most of the year hovering around 12 per game. For reference, Magic Johnson spent his career averaging around 11. John Stockton averaged 10-and-a-half. Not many expected this from Young, not now. Things had been getting more and more sticky in Atlanta over each of the past three years, the Hawks finishing lower and lower in the Eastern Conference standings. But the truth is, Young started prepping for this nearly two decades ago. “When I was a kid, I would wrap a ball in a garbage bag, walk into the garage and turn the lights off,” he says, describing how he’d try to hit targets he couldn’t see, with a basketball he could barely feel. He knew then the odds of becoming an NBA player were long, but he also never really doubted he would, not when right from the beginning it all felt so…real. Young grew up just 30 miles north of Oklahoma City. His family had Thunder season tickets and connections to some of the coaches and players through his dad, a former college player himself.

Текст новости: “I still have a lot of room to go. I’m going to be one of the best point guards to ever play, and imagine if I do it in Atlanta,” he says, noting it’s been a long time since the Hawks won anything. (Their lone championship came 67 years ago, in 1958.) “That’s my focus. I know we’re not in a position to be doing that right now, but I’ll do whatever it takes to get there.”

Текст новости: The trade has only aged better and better for Atlanta in the time since. Nance has become a key stabilizing vet presence, and Daniels has more than lived up to his “Great Barrier Thief” nickname, giving the Hawks a much-needed defensive menace while doubling his scoring output from last season. But most of all, the deal created clarity for and around Young. “Trae and Dejounte really were both trying to make it work, but it was more of, like, Should I do this or should you do this? and then, You do it and I will stay out of it, which meant neither could really be their full best self,” says Kyle Korver, one of the most prolific three-point shooters in NBA history and now the assistant general manager in Atlanta. “I think they were both trying to sacrifice and, ultimately, well, I was once given great marriage advice from my father-in-law. He said, If both of you are only compromising, you’re going to have a compromised marriage. There’s something to that with basketball, too.”

Текст новости: This summer, Snyder asked Young to buy in to what would be yet another fresh start for the organization he’s played for since 2018. Young said yes. “We use the word evolution a lot, and I think sometimes people are just at the right time in their lives to take a step,” Snyder says, noting how Young is still, well, young despite having been an NBA fixture for so long. At just 26, he’s at an age where a number of the kids he went to college with are still living with their parents. Yet Young himself is now a married father of two, playing in his eighth season and he is plainly now trying to do things a different way.

Текст новости: On a Tuesday afternoon when Marcus Smart did little but rest and heal his body, he still looks beat up. He has just completed a mandatory meeting, and though it’s still a shock to see him strolling inside the Washington Wizards’ practice facility, he’s covered in a team-issued gray sweatsuit as he takes a seat on the side of the gym. The Wizards’ logo seems foreign on him, but those stitches above his left eye make him look familiar. “Took a headbutt,” Smart says. “It was actually my first game here.” During his Feb. 21 debut with the Wizards, Smart, one of the grittiest, fieriest, most passionate players in the NBA, came off the bench for the worst team in the NBA. And though he played just 17 minutes that night, midway through his stint he would require three stitches. Then he came back in the game.

Текст новости: Smart, who turned 31 on Thursday, seems to have thought this one through. While looking out over the busy practice court, his new teammates getting up shots, Smart considers his reality and accepts the challenge. “Controlling what I can control is my motto now as I’ve gotten older,” Smart says, “and I think that helps a lot because we are put to the test. When you’re such a competitor and you’re so passionate, [then] to come to a team that’s young, rebuilding in a sense, you know, trying to figure it out. You know, it is frustrating, but the older you get, that experience, I went through it. So now I can see, sit down and understand by looking from 2017 till now, what can I do differently? And that is the way I respond.”

In 2017, wow, so I was [23]. So I was young, that was eight years ago,” Smart said, recalling the incident in Washington’s visitors’ locker room. “Growing and coming into the league at that time, everything was heightened. But I still ‘ till this day hate losing … but now it’s more understanding: ‘Hey, this is the situation you’re in. How are you going to respond? How are you going to let it affect you?’”

When you talk about what he’s done, what he does on the basketball court, there’s no one in the history of the NBA, and with all due respect to LeBron James, with all due respect to Michael Jordan, with all due respect to my favorite player of all time the great Shaquille O’Neal, there’s no one in the history of the NBA that has been schemed against and guarded the way Steph Curry is guarded. I mean, teams throw their whole defense at him, I’ve played in the NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers and got wide open layups, dunks in transition, because he’s running on the wing and they’d rather go run and take the three away from him on the wing and give me a dunk. Kevin Durant, one of the greatest scorers we’ve ever seen, got wide open dunk straight down the lane because Steph Curry’s on one wing, Klay Thompson on the other wing.

Both remarkable pieces of game-worn history will sell for the first time in more than a decade at Sotheby’s this spring, with the two jerseys expected to fetch a combined $20 million in arguably the most significant auction of NBA game-worn memorabilia in recent memory.

Текст новости: Ja Morant’s return to the starting lineup was met with a strong ovation from the FedExForum crowd before Wednesday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Memphis Grizzlies’ star was back, and his return came right on time. At least it felt that way, with Jaren Jackson Jr. being out with an ankle injury. But after the Grizzlies lost 120-103 to the Thunder, Morant admitted that he may have sped up his return. “Terrible,” Morant said on returning against the Thunder. “I should have been out. But I was out there. Regardless of out, in — there’s going to be something said.”

Текст новости: When asked after the game if he would be dealing with the shoulder injury for the rest of the season, Morant’s answer was short and sweet. “I don’t know,” he said. This is the second time this season Morant has alluded to the idea of not playing in a game while battling an injury. After the Grizzlies won their home opener, he said that he wouldn’t have played if it wasn’t for “Grizz Twitter” talking him into playing. “I think our medical (staff) does a good job of consolidating with you and kind of letting you know whether or not you’re in harm’s way or if you’re going to be playing through some pain or some soreness,” Bane said. “I think they do a pretty good job of protecting us.”

Текст новости: “The refs were terrible. Terrible as s—. It’s as simple as that,” DeMar DeRozan said after scoring a game-high 35 points, with only four in the fourth quarter. DeRozan shot just 2-of-6 in the final frame after pouring in 18 points in the third. “We got to do a better job of executing,” DeRozan said. “… There were multiple (calls missed). Check the free-throw difference. There was a bunch of times we got hit, got smacked. It was three, four shots I took, clearly got hit, got smacked. They get the same call on the other end. Throws off our whole rhythm. Gives them momentum at home. Makes it tough on us to execute. It was a game we should have had.”

Sacramento did not go quietly — Zach LaVine answered 20 seconds later to creep back within one score — but the Nuggets made the stops and free throws necessary to escape. Jokic had 22 points and 15 rebounds, but his six assists were matched by his turnovers. Murray was a team-best plus-21 en route to 24 points and eight assists. “Zeke didn’t play for a very long time, and as soon as he (was) implemented back in the lineup, he’s freaking hooping,” Murray said. “And not just putting the ball in the hoop. We don’t need him to just put the ball in the hoop. Dude is playing defense. He’s rebounding. He’s talking. He’s playing physical. He’s jumping. He’s blocking shots. He’s running the floor. He’s not complaining. I could go on.”

With the victory, the Cavs became the first NBA team to clinch a playoff berth. They needed only 62 games to do so, which is second only to the franchise record for an 82-game season of 60 games set by the 2008-09 Cavs, according to ESPN Research. The Cavs also became the second team in NBA history to record three 12-game win streaks in a season, joining the 2006-07 Dallas Mavericks. “It’s special.

And if you’re scoring that much, you know the scouting report is focused on you, and teams are trying to stop you. The fact that you’re able to get there, that says a lot about you. So, it’s just great company to be in, and it’s something that people have to respect.”

Harden is the first player in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game at the age of 35 or older while on the second night of a back-to-back that his team won. “To see him come out and score 50 on a back-to-back at the age of 35 just says a lot about him and competing every night,” said Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue, whose Clippers team improves to 33-29, good enough for eighth in the Western Conference with 20 games left to play. “Playing 38 minutes again on a back-to-back, but we needed every bit of it.”

I think the most important thing is to win the game. We had a lot of guys out; just got to be a little more aggressive, and aggressive means scoring and making plays.”

And now? “I’m certainly understanding of where I’m at,” he said this week. “It’s one of the things I told coach. I get it. I want to keep pouring into this team and doing whatever I can. Stay ready, and if I do or do not get time, I’m going to keep being a mentor or sounding board for [teammates].” That entails offering life lessons. “I let Tyler [Herro] come to me about stuff non-basketball related,” he said. “I’m trying to create a really great ecosystem here where we can celebrate each other, celebrate small wins, and build guys up. I know how this thing goes. It’s monotonous. Guys can get into a situation [where they’re wondering], ‘Are we headed for the play-in again? Or what are we doing?”

Текст новости: “I’m of the mind-set where you have to play it out and see what [happens],” he said. “You never know.” Even when he’s not playing, the intentions are pure, as coach Erik Spoelstra would say. “If I can impart any of that [knowledge] to any of these guys” that’s a positive, he said. “I’ve been lucky; I’ve done very well. I want to help them. Veterans matter.”

Текст новости: Anthony Edwards: I feel like right now is the time that we can we can take that next step I’ll say that. If we healthy I feel like we can be special. So we just got to stay healthy. If we stay healthy we can go on a little run for sure.

Текст новости: With 20 games left in the regular season, the Timberwolves are 33-29 and stand in ninth place in the Western Conference by a mere percentage point; they are a half-game out of sixth place, the final spot that avoids the play-in games. From here, Tankathon.com projects them to have the NBA’s second-easiest schedule, based on opponents’ winning percentage.  This is both a blessing and a curse for these Wolves. Coach Chris Finch summed it up well after the Wolves dropped what should have been a win Friday night at Utah, even without Anthony Edwards (because of his suspension) and multiple injured players. “It doesn’t matter whether a team is above or below us, the most dangerous team to us is us,” Finch said. “We have to recognize that and guard against it better.”

Текст новости: Despite standing 7 feet, Washington Wizards center Alex Sarr has spent much of his rookie season finding it difficult to score in the paint. The Frenchman’s adjustment to the physical nature of the NBA has been reflected most in his struggles to score at the rim. But in a 125-122 win over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday at Capital One Arena, Sarr showed signs of growth. The rookie scored 21 points and missed just one of his seven shots in the paint, displaying a willingness to initiate — and play through — contact near the basket. “Definitely just trying to be aggressive,” Sarr said, “get some easy ones around the rim before spacing out.” Wizards Coach Brian Keefe distilled what he wanted Sarr to take from the performance in simple terms: “Be aggressive, establish yourself early in the paint,” Keefe said. “That collapses the defense. He’s such a good passer, that’s going to lead to him finding other guys.”

Текст новости: Casey Smith, the vice president of sports medicine for the Knicks, indirectly played a role in Luka Doncic getting traded by the Mavericks. Smith was a longtime trainer in Dallas before getting surprisingly fired by GM Nico Harrison in 2023. His departure — along with the firing of Mavericks strength and conditioning coach Jeremy Holsopple — was supposed to help Doncic get into better shape.

Текст новости: But Doncic enjoyed working with those two. And the Mavs replaced them with European staffers who were handpicked by Doncic and too friendly with the All-Star to get him to work. They struggled to keep Doncic disciplined, according to a source with knowledge of the situation, and it progressed to the Mavericks trading their franchise player amid concerns about, among other things, his long-term health. After a year off, Smith joined the Knicks before this season. The Knicks also hired another former member of the Mavericks’ training staff, Heather Mau, the team’s senior athletic trainer. According to sources, Mau works closely with Jalen Brunson. They also worked together when they were both in Dallas.

Текст новости: Mavericks coach Jason Kidd was asked before Wednesday’s game in Milwaukee about the perception that Irving’s increased workload played a factor in his torn ACL. Kidd vehemently disagreed with the notion and spoke for over four minutes, while broadening the conversation about resting All-Stars as opposed to playing them as much as possible. “The load didn’t have anything to do with the injury,” Kidd said. “We’re talking about one play. It’s a freak accident. That’s how it should be reported, but we’re not reporting it right. We’re reporting on conspiracy theories.

Understanding a large goal of what we’re trying to do as a team, but also understanding it’s a long season. You may have two, three games where you don’t play your best, but that frustration can’t linger on. That’s what I’ve learned in my career and am still continuing to learn and navigate.”

If you were willing to part with Mark Williams—who’s 23 and pretty good, though he has some injury concerns—the next logical thing would be to also look at LaMelo Ball. He’s on a max contract, and they’re not winning, obviously, for the foreseeable future. For LaMelo, he wants to win. This is now going to be his fifth season. How much longer does he see himself there? That’s what I’ve been told. And I’ll say this, Matt—at the end of the day, I also think not being an All-Star and not winning affected him. He had the numbers on paper, but Charlotte’s record hurt his chances. From what I’ve been told, he wants to win competitively.

Текст новости: “The heart of why the Mavericks didn’t pay Luka Doncic, or traded Luka Doncic, was because they didn’t want to pay him,” said Brian Windhorst on Unsportsmanlike. “At the end of the day, they did not think a $300 million investment was smart in Luka. We could spend hours debating whether that’s true or not, but that’s what they saw. “The idea that we are in an era where you just take all your players on your roster and just immediately pay them the max just no matter what… That era, I believe, is coming to a close. I believe we are just at the beginning of seeing teams getting, especially that second max contract, and just instantaneously handing it to them [is over]. And so when we watch guys in the middle of their careers… let’s see how these playoffs go and let’s see when some of these extensions come up whether those extensions get done. We’re in a new era right now where you cannot make a mistake on a big contract, which is the lesson that the Sixers and the Suns to a certain extent are learning right now.”

Текст новости: Dyson Daniels has been a monster this season, and rightfully has garnered lots of recognition for his outrageous defensive playmaking. Many think he’s the DPOY. Daniels ranks second in the DPOY race, per the sportsbooks. Camara’s name, somehow, is nowhere to be found, as of Tuesday afternoon. The 13 names in the DPOY race (and Alex Sarr ?!?!??!): Camara’s name isn’t listed — I have a sneaky suspicion — because defensive stops aren’t in the box score. Luckily for us, pbpstats.com tracks offensive fouls drawn and charges. nbarapm tracks Stop% for every player (among a giant pile of fun things), and Camara shines there. So it’s out there, even if it isn’t officially on the paper that coaches hold in their hand at press conferences.

Текст новости: Look, it’s going to be hard for a perimeter player like Camara or Daniels to win DPOY. The rim is still the most important real estate in the game. Camara isn’t an elite shotblocker, but he takes a ton of charges there and blocks can be misleading when it comes to player value. Blocks alone should not be considered stops unless the defensive team recovers the swatted shot. Luckily, nbarapm.com’s Stop% makes this distinction and guys like Jaren Jackson Jr., who gives back more than 46 percent of his blocks back to the offense, get properly credited with “true” stops.

Текст новости: The Thunder have outscored opponents by 12.7 points per game this season, which is on pace to break an NBA record that has stood for over 50 years. The current mark is 12.3 points per game by the 1971-72 Lakers, who famously won 33 games in a row. 2. While that margin of victory is a regular-season record, history suggests that level of dominance should translate to the playoffs. The previous top five teams in point differential — the 1971-72 Lakers, 1970-71 Bucks, 1995-96 Bulls, 2016-17 Warriors, and 2023-24 Celtics — all coasted to titles, with a combined 71-12 record in the postseason. None even faced a Game 7 en route to the championship.

Текст новости: What happens when you win the turnover battle by a massive margin? You win the battle for points off turnovers by a massive margin, too. The Thunder lead the league in translating takeaways to points on both ends: They score the most points off opponent turnovers (22.4 per game) and allow the fewest points off their own turnovers (12.9), giving them an extra 9.5 points per game. No other team has a margin even half that large.

Текст новости: We miss Jalen so immensely. He’s the heart and soul of what we do defensively. He applies constant ball pressure. He’s flying around the court making stuff so much easier on the rest of us because we’re able to use his defense to create offense. Whether it’s his steals, chasing guys down, blocking shots or him just forcing guys in the bad shots, it ignites our offense. So not having him out there, it’s been tough. And honestly, we’ll never be as good of a team as we can be unless he’s out there. We know that we have to hold it down. And he’s been great just being vocal, still being a leader, trying to encourage guys throughout the time he has been out. But we miss him a lot. Just that one game he played before he got hurt, against Detroit, you could feel the difference he made. And just his energy and his enthusiasm and just his toughness and everything he brings on the court, you know, takes our team to another level.

Текст новости: But Russell — whose 8.7 assists per 100 possessions with the Lakers were his worst since his rookie season — has handed out a dozen per 100 since joining the Nets, the best in his career by a huge margin. With the ball in his hands and a leadership role, Russell is believed to have told those around him he wants to stay. He scored 12 with four assists in Tuesday’s loss. And despite the rebuild, the Nets keeping him around seems a lot more likely than it did when he first arrived three months ago.

Текст новости: Yes, Marks — who used to weaponize offer sheets in his first rebuild — could use cap space on restricted free agents like Jonathan Kuminga or Josh Giddey. But the GM could kick the can down the road a year, extending the tank another season and punting his cap space into 2026. If he does, one way is giving Russell a one-year deal, or a two-year contract with a team option. With the Nets sitting on a trove of cap space almost as big as the rest of the league combined — Detroit is the only other team likely to have more than the mid-level exception — Russell’s suitors will be limited.

Текст новости: James, who entered the game one point shy of 50,000 total in regular season and playoff scoring, got across the threshold with a first quarter three before making four more. He scored 34 to lead the Lakers, along with eight rebounds and six assists, either he or Doncic perfectly picking the opposition apart at all times. “In order for us to be the team ultimately we need to be, the ball needs to be in Luka’s hands,” James said. “And then when Luka sits down, the ball can be in my hands or be AR’s hands when he gets back. But I’m very comfortable playing off the ball and finding my spots, running the floor, getting the outlet pass from Luka, being on the backside of the defense if he’s either being blitzed in pick-and-rolls or switched in pick-and-rolls. He attracts so many eyes and bodies.

Текст новости: The Raptors head coach pulled all his veterans off the floor in a tight game with the Orlando Magic and gave his young players a chance to shine when it mattered the most. And while Orlando’s Paolo Banchero, with a game-high 41 points, threatened to take the game away, Raptors rookie Ja’Kobe Walter hit a three-pointer with a half-second left to give Toronto a 114-113 win. “The last play … Coach drew it up for me,” a confident Walter told TSN after the buzzer. A game that was close early got chirpy midway through the third quarter, with players getting in each other’s faces and a technical foul being issued. The skirmish ignited a spark in the Raptors, who outscored the Magic 31-19 in that quarter and built a 12-point lead in the fourth, only to squander it late.

Текст новости: The Nets were in striking distance midway through the third quarter before they allowed a 26-8 Spurs run. After Stephon Castle’s dunk left them down 95-70 with 1:46 left in the period, the rest of the night was garbage time. “[Vassell] just plays simple basketball. And obviously it was not fun to watch for me,” Fernandez said. “We should’ve been better, get him off the 3-point line, make him dribble more, maybe we get him in trouble. But we were not able to do it. So once again, our defense has got to be challenged. We have to be better.”

Текст новости: “As the supreme leader of The Big Man Alliance, I demand you fans start putting Steph Curry in the greatest-of-all-time conversation. Just start putting him in the conversation. I demand it. I played against Mike, played with Kobe, and played against and with LeBron. They’re all great, but at some point, we have to start putting Steph Curry in that category. I’m not saying he is, but let’s just have the conversation. I have never seen anything like this before, and nobody has.” It goes without saying that if Stephen Curry were to retire right now, he would still be a consensus top 15 to top 10 player of all time. However, the transcendent point guard’s cement is still dry as he continues to add to his legacy. And it does not look like he’s slowing down anytime soon, even at this stage in his career.

Текст новости: Gary Payton: So, I’m going to tell you how this went. In ’96, I made First Team All-NBA. I made First Team All-Defense. I was on the Olympic team. We won a gold medal. I got the first contract for a point guard to be the highest-paid ever—they gave me $92 million. For the first time. For the first time—92! I won Defensive Player of the Year. And then, all of a sudden, everything started rolling in at once. You know what I’m saying? I did all of that in one year. I won almost everything in basketball during that time. I was on every team, every accolade—I was on the All-Star Team, all that. I almost won MVP in the All-Star Game, but they gave it to Mitch Richmond. I lost by one vote on that. My life was on cloud 20. And I made it cloud 20 because I was in the club every night after that. Then, we went to Atlanta for the Olympics, and we were out every night—in the strip club every night—and blowing everybody out. Dream Team 2 was in Atlanta. To make that and do that—that was one of the best things ever.

And then we took six of their Dream Team 1 guys and put them on our team. But y’all gotta understand—DC and them were the ones who went to the qualifying tournament and didn’t make the final Dream Team 2 roster. You remember that? Him, Shawn Kemp, and all of them—they got taken off. Because, you know, they started acting up, acting crazy. So they put us on there.

You know, the West hated the East, and the East hated the West. We used to go at each other. We weren’t friends. We didn’t take off our jerseys, hold them up at half court, take pictures together, and swap them. I didn’t care about none of that. The only time I was dealing with someone on a different team was at the All-Star Game. “Hey, what’s up? What’s going on?” That’s it. After that, we ain’t like this no more. You feel what I’m saying?

I’ve been fortunate to have witnessed his journey, his continued evolution and growth over the years, and am incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to see him approach the game of basketball with the same energy and fierce passion for the game that he did as a young man on the verge of his career. His work ethic and absolute dedication to his craft, it’s cut from the cloth of greats. I know it, I lived it, and I see the same ferocity and passion in him that I saw in Kobe. “All my thoughts and that of our staff are with Kyrie and his family, and we are confident that he will come back from this stronger than ever just like he always has.”

Текст новости: From 1950 to 2015, naming captains had been a regular part of Celtics franchise history, though one hasn’t officially been announced since. Paul Pierce last prominently filled that role over a decade ago, and Rajon Rondo briefly succeeded him before he was traded. After that, Brad Stevens steered the organization away from captains in an effort to empower everyone. Head coach Joe Mazzulla began the 2023-24 championship season explaining that naming a captain would make the Celtics overly reliant on one player. What if he doesn’t show up? It would have been a big deal—and worthy of a ceremonious announcement—if Jaylen Brown had joined that lineage and restarted the tradition.

Текст новости: But to be clear, Boston never officially named Brown a captain, which he later clarified at 2025 NBA All-Star Weekend. It’s understood, he said, that he assumes that role because he’s been on the team the longest. “Even though we don’t necessarily have it written down, the team moves to the things that me and Jayson [Tatum] do,” Brown said. “Even though we have a lot of great players, I feel like my team relies on me to be the leader, the vocal leader. I would say I’ve taken that role and defensively, being the head of the snake, taking on those matchups. My team feeds off that. It’s kind of understood, I guess.”

I speak a lot on different platforms, so I’ve been able to carry that more a little bit, trying to just keep our morale, speaking life into everybody, talking to everybody on the bench, keeping that good feng shui.”

Текст новости: Shams Charania: The relationship between Luka Dončić and the Mavericks’ organization had deteriorated. In many ways, Kyrie was the bridge between them. The front office even leaned on Kyrie for communication with Luka. So, now that relationship is strained, they trade Luka, and yeah—Anthony Davis has been out since his first game with the Lakers. I think he and his representatives are going to huddle up. They’ll have some tough conversations. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that the one game we saw was the last we see of Anthony Davis this season.

He just bought a new home there—a lofty, lofty price. He didn’t want to go anywhere. Players from abroad tend to be very committed and loyal. That’s how Luka viewed his relationship with the Mavericks—one team, one city, forever.

To my knowledge, Pat, there’s zero truth to that. It’s just not a reality.

Jokić is putting up insane numbers—maybe even better than his previous MVP seasons. But SGA’s impact has been huge.

Buck (Magic Johnson), (Larry) Bird, bad motherf*cker. You know me, I’m rolling purple and gold, bro, I mean I grew up a Laker fan, I grew up in Coop’s Camp. I’m automatically purple and gold, Lakers, hate the Celtics. There’s no other way, but you have to respect the hell out of Larry Bird, man what he did on the court was unbelievable. MJ (Michael Jordan) definitely. MJ, no question about MJ. No question, he’s everybody’s number one pretty much. The fifth one is always hard, but I’m going to say Bill Russell.

Текст новости: Darius Gudelis, a prominent member of the FIBA Europe board, has recently addressed the ongoing talks about the NBA potentially expanding into Europe. Gudelis attended the press conference in Vilnius, where the Rytas Vilnius budget was presented, as he is also the chairman of the Lithuanian club’s board. Regarding the potential NBA Europe expansion, Gudelis’ message was clear: any NBA move into European basketball will have to go through FIBA, the international governing body for the sport. “If the NBA comes to Europe, it will only be with FIBA,” Gudelis noted.

The results aren’t there yet, and it seems FIBA is focusing on other partners,” he added.

Irving appeared in 50 of Mavs’ 62 games so far, and is currently the only player in the NBA averaging at least 20 points, 40% 3-point shooting and 90% from free throw line — the fifth season in his career with those statistics, second most all-time to Stephen Curry.

Текст новости: His move from the Dallas Mavericks to the LA Lakers was a jaw-dropping moment in January and one that took Nash himself by surprise. He explained: “I think everybody was shocked. They clearly did an incredible job, especially in today’s age of keeping it quiet. “It definitely changes the landscape of the NBA and the Western Conference. And, you know, even the next 10 years, having one of the best players in the game go to the Lakers.” He added: “You have a young player entering his prime and hopefully going to stay there for a minimum of five to hopefully 10 years. “That’s the part that is the most difficult part of the equation, because regardless of how it goes, luck is involved in all these things, but to get a star of his quality at his age is remarkable for the Lakers.”

Текст новости: The former Laker mused: “I think they have a chance. They’ve opened the door to be a contender, but there’s so much they have to sort out.  “You know, they’re just starting to play together. You have two players that are actually quite similar. LeBron (James) and Luka, they both are playmaking forwards.  “They kind of are point forwards. So trying to make all those pieces fit, trying to get their defense solid. You know, they’re a little thin at the center position, but they have great positional size. “…(I am) very interested to see, and I think they definitely could play themselves into contention, but I think it’s really early to say that when we haven’t seen it at least for a few weeks to see maybe some light, some understanding, some connectivity, but there’s a chance.

So if he didn’t overtake the person then he’s out actually out of the conversation.

Текст новости: Kerr has long voiced his displeasure at the lack of traveling calls in the NBA, dating back to a 2016 radio interview when he made many of the same points, calling it an extra “unfair” advantage for the offense. “The rules are already sort of geared towards the offense — you can’t handcheck, you can’t put a hand on a guy or it’s a foul,” Kerr said. “We give so many advantages to the offense; to let them travel and to let them carry the ball is kind of ridiculous to me.” Kerr said he has brought this issue to the competition committee and made his feelings heard to commissioner Adam Silver. “Maybe I’ll hear back from them after these comments,” Kerr said Monday night. “But for the good of the game, we need to enforce traveling violations.”

I think everyone came in the league and they said, well, he’s a seven-footer who can’t really post well, but he can shoot, he can post up on the mid posts from the elbows. He can isolate and always get a shot from the nail or the mid-range areas.

Kerr received a technical foul in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 119-101 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night after becoming irate when what he viewed as an obvious travel wasn’t called. Kerr pointed to the crowd, where some fans were screaming for a traveling call. “I don’t understand why we are not teaching our officials to call travel in this league,” Kerr said. “They do a great job and work their tails off and communicate well, but I see five or six travels a game that aren’t called.”

Текст новости: Reserve center Alex Len, one of two Ukrainian players active in the NBA, said he’s seen public support for his country’s fight against Russia wane since the war’s first days, and he’s hoping the news coverage of the argument between America’s and Ukraine’s political leaders can be a step toward resolution. “At the end of the day, we all want just one thing — for the war to stop and for everybody to feel safe again,” Len told The Times on Sunday. “I think that’s the end goal of this whole thing. People just want to live normal life. Like my friends and family that I talked to back home, everybody wants that. … We’re tired of the war. We want the war to stop and we want to come back to normal life and just, live normal life. “Cause this is crazy.”

But hopefully they’ll be able to come up with a solution to finally stop the war and in a way that Ukraine is protected,” Len said. “Because all Zelensky said is, ‘Yeah, we want a ceasefire. But in the past, Putin broke this ceasefire so many times. We need security to make sure when the ceasefire is not enough. He signed it so many times, and he broke it, and we’re still getting attacked. What’s the purpose of ceasefire? We need more than just ceasefire.”

Guerschon Yabusele: I always told myself that I wanted to come back, and I had to do everything in my power to come back. I had to work as hard as possible to come back. Every summer, it was almost, so I was telling myself to keep pushing, and it would definitely come. Hard work always pays off. That was my motto every day. Try and get that second chance.

Текст новости: RJ Barrett was discussed in trade talks for Brandon Ingram with New Orleans, but the Pelicans preferred the expiring contract of Bruce Brown and stretch-five center Kelly Olynyk, who’s owed $13.45 million next season, league sources told HoopsHype. With Trey Murphy III and Herb Jones already on the wing, the Pelicans didn’t view Barrett as a suitable fit for their roster as talks would have necessitated finding a third team, sources said.

Текст новости: Sources told HoopsHype that the Hawks and Pelicans had several three-team trade conversations, which included two of the following four players leaving Atlanta in different trade scenarios for Ingram that ultimately fell through: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu, De’Andre Hunter, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Hunter and Bogdanovic were traded to the Cavaliers and Clippers in separate deals. Atlanta is ideally not looking to go over the luxury tax threshold next season, HoopsHype has learned, which will play a role in the team’s roster construction this summer and the futures of those veterans.

Текст новости: Before the Dallas Mavericks traded Luka Doncic in a blockbuster deal to acquire Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round draft pick, the team also expressed interest in Jimmy Butler and Kyle Kuzma, league sources told HoopsHype. PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford briefly came up in trade talks for Butler, but exploratory discussions didn’t go far, league sources told HoopsHype. At the time, Miami sought starting-caliber players on short-term deals who could help the Heat compete this season while giving them financial flexibility for the future as part of a trade package for the disgruntled Butler. This offseason, representatives for Gafford (Klutch Sports Group) and Washington (LIFT Sports Management) are expected to engage in extension talks with Mavericks management, league sources told HoopsHype.

Текст новости: As the NBA’s most winningest and most storied franchise, there is no paucity of documentaries about the Boston Celtics. In fact, quite the opposite — one could seemingly fill weeks of time watching just the better-known stabs at putting the history of the team into a video format. But there is a new contender on the scene in that regard, and we are not referring to NBA titles here, or at least directly. The Ringer’s Bill Simmons and HBO have teamed up to bring the world “Celtics City,” a new documentary series that aims about as high as one can with these things. The Celtics Wire recently sat down with the director, Lauren Stowell, and co-executive producer and showrunner Gabe Honig to talk about the new docuseries and what sets it apart in a sea of similar content. To that question in particular, Stowell was forthright in her reply. “This one is the definitive complete story, not told in bits and pieces or your favorite iconic moments or eras,” she explained. “We’re starting from Red Auerbach getting the job and Walter A. Brown owning the team through Banner 18, and the journey to that.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: Quite the epic journey, we are immediately set on the odyssey that is the history of the Celtics, a tall order in terms of sports documentarianism if ever there was one. “I think from that perspective, it’s going to be different,” she continued. “But I think also with this story, we knew that there were so many layers to it that went beyond just these iconic names and iconic moments, but that there was a real genuine connection between the Boston Celtics, the city of Boston, and American history, and really the story too of Black empowerment in America that comes through from Bill Russell to Jaylen Brown and that lineage.” As we alluded to above, there’s a lot to chew on with the history of the Celtics, and it appears this production team has not shied away from the challenge.

Lauren’s vision was always to like focus on the people, the character,” he added.

Текст новости: However, Ware still played and was productive down the stretch Friday — even playing the final 4:50 of the game despite not starting the second half on the court. He bounced back from a slow start to that game, recording four points and eight rebounds while posting a team-best plus/minus of plus-13 in 14 second-half minutes. “I think it speaks to his competitive character,” Spoelstra said when asked about Ware’s encouraging second-half response Friday after beginning the third quarter on the bench. “He’s learning basically through a fire hose right now. These games have such context and meaning and consequences to them. He’s not being gifted minutes for a young guy. But there are a lot of things that are scouting report related or just competition related or context of a particular point in a game, and he’s really been good with all of that. “I thought he had a really good impact in the second half. He could have very easily just gone the other way mentally for whatever reason. Some younger players do that in this league. But those were really important minutes in the second half and good learning lessons from the first half.”

Текст новости: But after playing 26 minutes and posting a plus/minus of plus-2 through the first three quarters Sunday, he spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench except for entering to play the final 3.5 seconds of regulation for a defensive possession. The Heat led by 19 with 7:10 left in the third quarter, found itself ahead by 12 with 8:29 remaining in the fourth quarter and still lost to the Knicks in overtime on Sunday. It marked the 15th loss that the Heat has blown a double-digit lead in this season, which is the second most such collapses in the NBA this season behind only the Utah Jazz. Without Ware on the court, the Heat was outscored by six points in the fourth quarter.

Текст новости: “He was fine,” Spoelstra said when asked whether an injury is what kept Ware off the court for most of Sunday’s fourth period. “We were trying to match a little bit of the perimeter stuff. We had a lead, I didn’t want the threes to get to us. It wasn’t necessarily anything that he was doing.” Ware then played the first 3:06 of overtime before heading back to the bench for the rest of the game. “I mean, he’s the coach for a reason,” Ware said of Spoelstra’s decision to sit him for most of Sunday’s fourth quarter. “I’m a rookie, so I can’t really say anything about that. His decision is his decision and I’m going to go with it.”

I’m a rookie, so I just want to get better at being straight, being tall, trying to affect the game defensively more than I have been a little bit,” Ware said after setting a new career-high in blocks on Sunday. “Try to get back to how I was at the beginning of the season. Just trying to go for everything, affect everything and try to get as many blocks as I can.”

Текст новости: Just as opponents are likely to dare Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Peyton Watson and even Christian Braun to shoot 3s in order to disrupt Denver’s spacing, they’ll be equally inclined to target perceived weaknesses at the other end. That could mean steering Murray, Nikola Jokic or Michael Porter Jr. into the action. Murray has seen a lot of it this season. “For sure, 100%,” he said when asked if he relishes those situations. “It’s just tough when I have four fouls, you know what I’m saying?”

Minutes later, he stood his ground while getting backed down by Brown long enough for Brown to get called for a travel. Brown didn’t give up. He scored on Murray twice inside of 12 feet later in the third quarter. “I think he’s a good defender. He is not a target, for sure. But I think collectively we need to give him a little bit of help,” Jokic said of Murray. “If somebody is backing you down who is taller and maybe stronger than you, we need to have someone to be there … so we can not just leave the guy on an island. But I think he played a special second half. I think he played really good.”

Текст новости: A brutal season for the Phoenix Suns hit a low Sunday night with a humiliating 116-98 home loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. “We didn’t play up to our standards at all,” All-Star forward Kevin Durant said. “We embarrassed the fans and we embarrassed ourselves the way we played. I want us to be better.” Phoenix lost for the 11th time in 14 games and fell to 28-33 for the season. The team is four games behind the Dallas Mavericks for the final spot in the Western Conference play-in tournament and will need a minor miracle over the final 21 games of the season just to have a chance at the postseason.

Текст новости: Minnesota was the team that swept Phoenix out of the playoffs last season in the first round. The Timberwolves have won all three regular-season meetings this season. “When adversity hits, we start floating a little as a team,” Durant said. “That’s tough to deal with it.” Phoenix tied a season high with 22 turnovers and gave up a season-high 40 points off those turnovers. Durant, Booker and Beal combined for 14 of the turnovers. “That’s why we lost,” Durant said. “Forty points off turnovers, tough to overcome that. They didn’t overpower us on the glass, we just gave them the ball.”

Williams, Champagnie and Dort were ejected.

Текст новости: With three minutes left in the third quarter, Williams was elbowed in the jaw while guarding Champagnie as he passed to Stephon Castle, who found Sochan cutting under the basket for a two-handed dunk. As that play unfolded, Williams and Champagnie stood near the scorer’s table, shoving each other. “When people are aggressive, there are a lot of coincidental elbows or contact,” Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. “I don’t really know who was at fault, to be honest. But it just looked like that was what initiated it. And then there was the response on both ends. [It] just looked like Kenrich Williams was being aggressive, and Julian was opening up. I don’t know if that’s an offensive foul now. I don’t know where that line is of what space you’re allowed.”

Beal has two seasons left on the deal after this one valued at nearly $111 million.

League sources say such a move is indeed being considered by the Mavericks, but I’m also told health and team roster needs at that point will influence that decision.

Opportunities on the offensive boards. If it’s (Julius) Randle and (Naz) Reid or whoever their backup bigs are, make them have to move and guard the pick-and-roll. Just be aggressive, attacking, just generally speaking but also make an effort to get to the offensive boards some too.” #Suns pic.x.com/XNKQ4GHIbr

Текст новости: Over the 67 games (including the postseason) that Robinson has scored at least 20 points in during his seven-year NBA career ahead of Sunday’s matchup against the Knicks, the Heat holds an impressive 52-15 record. “When Duncan is aggressive and being himself, I feel like our offense goes to another level,” Heat guard Tyler Herro said.

Текст новости: Between Robinson’s two-man game with starting center Bam Adebayo and Robinson serving as a three-point threat who opponents have to game plan for, there’s more space for the Heat’s offense to operate when Robinson is on the court and especially when Robinson is making a bunch of threes. “I know there’s analytics to it now. But there are players where you just know they tilt the defense differently,” Spoelstra said. “Shooters, the catch-and-shoot guys, guys that come off screens. Duncan is one of those guys. He just is. That’s the reality. You can run those actions for other players and it’s not going to create quite the same reactions. And that’s from years of reputation of being deadly coming off screens.”

Текст новости: Herro added: “He’s really the guy who can create overreactions for the defense.” Robinson, 30, has noticed those overreactions from opposing defenses become even more common over the years. “When shots go in and sometimes even when they don’t just because of the scouting report and reputation, I can create some overreactions and hopefully help get guys some easy ones,” said Robinson, who entered Sunday with 30 starts in 55 appearances this season. “That’s generating offense, too. It’s not always just if the ball is going in or not. But sometimes I feel like I can help just us function on that end in other ways, too. So trying to be a complete player, more of a complete player and more of a threat than just shooting from three.”

Текст новости: The Orlando Magic have three games remaining on their current seven-game homestand. If they want to make this stretch at Kia Center a success, they’ll need to handle their business against the type of opponents they dominated in this scenario last season. All three matchups at Kia Center are against squads with records below .500. In that situation during its 2023-24 campaign, Orlando went a stellar 17-0. The Magic (29-32) will look to repeat last season’s path to success when they square off with the Toronto Raptors (18-42) on Sunday at 6 p.m. ET. “Our ability to focus in on the game plan, play the right way, (and) understand what we need to do well in order to get the game (will all be key),” said Magic head coach Jamahl Mosley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: The contest will mark the first of two straight meetings in Orlando between the two clubs. The Magic look at that as an opportunity to simulate a playoff series as each squad makes adjustments and countermoves possession to possession, quarter to quarter, and game to game. “Those are very important pieces in games like this,” Mosley explained. “You’re happy it’s happening at this time of year.” Orlando is coming off a heartbreaking 121-115 loss to the Golden State Warriors where a 41-point showing from Paolo Banchero was spoiled by a 56-point masterclass from Steph Curry. However, there were some positives to build on, even from the defeat. “We’ve been playing good basketball, we just have to finish the job,” said Mosley. “I think that’s a big portion of it. We’re starting March, starting new, (and) we want to be playing our best basketball in this month into April. That’s what these guys understand and we’re hanging our hat on.”

Текст новости: Shams Charania: “This all came to a head over the last couple of weeks, specifically, what I’m told, Joel Embiid went directly to 76ers’ owner Josh Harris about the state of his knee, and about where the realization he’s at with what’s the best interest for him and the organization as far as a potential shutdown… Because remember, Josh Harris owes Joel Embiid up to 300 million over the next five seasons. So, the backdrop to all this is that over the last month we’ve seen fundamental differences between Joel Embiid and the 76ers as far as Embiid believing that he needs a different treatment approach for this versus the 76ers feeling ‘you play on it, get in better condition, and you can continue on this year’. This has been a situation the 76ers have been dealing with all season and they managed the swelling in multiple different ways, including injections monthly just to get him on the court. But here they are in lockstep. This is all about getting Joel Embiid back on the court in the best, sustainable way. And they are in lockstep about that.”

Текст новости: This was the second time since the All-Star break they had given up more than 45 points in the second quarter. After the game Saturday, it was something multiple Grizzlies players made note of as frustration mounts over the defensive effort and intensity. “Energy is not there,” forward Santi Aldama said. ” . . . I can sit here and just say it’s there, but it’s not. It’s clearly not. We’re just letting teams punk us every single night, and then we make up for it and we just hope the coin flips our way. We can’t play that way. We’re not that team that needs a little bit of luck. We normally set the tone and we haven’t been doing that.”

Текст новости: And in Memphis, nothing is more frustrating than bad defense and rebounding. Those are two areas in which this team prides itself. “It’s urgency,” Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. “It’s undiscipline in our transition habits. Point of attack defense. We’re in retreat mode too much. We got to be more physical on the ball . . . And then the rebounding is a huge weakness. This is all things we’re fully capable of doing if we’re committed to it. I’m challenging the guys that this can’t be the case.”

Текст новости: With just over seven minutes left in the fourth quarter Saturday, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry leaked out after seeing teammate Buddy Hield steal the ball. Hield quickly passed it to Curry for what usually would be a breakaway layup. Except, for the first time since 2019, Curry threw down a one-handed dunk as Golden State fans at Wells Fargo Center roared. At the 7:15 mark, Curry recorded his 27th career regular-season dunk. But he said after the 126-119 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers that it was the final slam of his storied career. “That will probably be my last dunk,” Curry said. “I’m calling it right now. That was the last one you’re going to see.”

But in a one-point game that came down to the final possession, Big Mitch made a big impact in a small amount of time. “For the first game back, with the amount of time he’s been out, I thought it was really, really good,” Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau said after the victory. “Just having the pick-and-roll defense, the rim protection, the rebounding, and he made a lot of good plays just moving on penetration, pressure on the rim offensively, those things are huge. “It opens up space for us, so the more you can open up space, the better our offense is gonna be.”

Текст новости: The Warriors acquired Jimmy Butler from the Miami Heat before the deadline, adding him to a roster featuring Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. “The Jimmy addition is amazing,” Gary Payton II said. “His skill, his IQ and what he brings. … Jimmy is just a dog. He loves to hoop.” Through his first seven games with the Warriors, he’s averaged 18 points, six rebounds and 5.4 assists. “He goes out there and plays his heart out and he is a great fit for us. He can play big or small but just that addition to what Draymond and Steph bring for us, it’s just amazing. … We will continue to figure it out and get him accustomed to everything but it won’t be too hard. He is a high IQ level guy and loves to play the right way.”

Hopefully, in the next couple of years, they can figure it out and bring it back and that my dad is a part of it.”

At that point, an independent doctor selected by the NBA and NBPA would examine Embiid. If agreed he can no longer play, his remaining contract would be wiped off the books for the Sixers.

Текст новости: The determination on whether Embiid suffered a career-ending injury would be made by a physician selected by the NBA and the players’ association. If that’s the case, then starting on Feb. 22, 2026 (one year from the last game Embiid played), Philadelphia could apply to the NBA to have Embiid’s salary for the years of his contract removed from its cap sheet. The Sixers would also have to waive Embiid.

The win was Cleveland’s ninth in a row — its last loss was Feb. 4 against these same Celtics — and with it the Cavs improved to an NBA-best 49-10. They’ve already won more games than they did last season, which ended with a second-round loss in the playoffs to Boston. It was Cleveland’s largest comeback in 11 years; the Cavs also overcame a 22-point deficit to beat the Celtics on March 5, 2014.

We put in the grind. We put in the time. We’ve always given respect and props to the generation that came before us. We know that without them, there would be no us. We’re just trying to carry on that tradition—me, Steph, KD, Russ, James, Kawhi, and the rest of our crew. And now, the younger generation is doing their thing as well. We love what we do, and it’s our responsibility to push the game forward in a positive way for fans all over America and the world. This is the best, most beautiful game in the world. When you watch basketball, you’re basically listening to music—jazz, R&B, rap, heavy metal—everything. It’s all in the game. We’re in a position to play this game, and we’re here for a reason. We never take it for granted. I hope everybody sees that when we step on the floor.

Текст новости: LeBron James: Exactly made my point but anyways. Happy this convo has started. It ain’t about ‘face of the game” and it ain’t about one person or one show, it’s about the culture of basketball,, the most beautiful game in the world. Our game has never been better. Incredible young stars from all over the world and some older ones 🤣🤣🤣 Stephen Curry should be all we are talking about today. Let’s discuss how great OKC and The Cavs have been this season with 2 completely different styles and break down why and how they have. Of course if players don’t perform we need to discuss that too and break that down. Even that can be discussed in a way that’s not to bring finality to that players game but to leave room to see how that player responds and let’s watch the journey of that player. This ain’t about me either. At this point i dont really care what’s said about me it’s always something. This is about the impact the negativity is having on our beautiful game and our fans. I know I speak for a lot of players and more importantly, a helluva lot of great fans that truly love and celebrate this sport around the world. #MindtheGame 💭🧠👑

The trochlea is a groove in the lower end of the femur that guides the kneecap during knee movements, according to drrobertlaprademd.com. Damage to the trochlea can cause pain, instability and other problems with the knee, the website said. Treatment options, which will be explored by the franchise, include rest, physical therapy, medicine or arthroscopic surgery, according to the website.

Текст новости: Ian Begley: Something worth noting: due to financial restrictions, Dallas can’t sign Moses Brown to a second 10 day deal. The center is among players on the Knicks’ radar for 15th roster spot, per people familiar with the matter. Brown, who played high school basketball at Archbishop Molloy, spent time with the Westchester Knicks earlier this season. He is currently on a 10 day deal with Dallas. Brown, 25, put up 21 points, 11 rebounds, three steals and two blocks in 31 minutes against Charlotte. Dallas can’t immediately sign Brown to another 10-day deal because it is hard-capped at the first apron. Westchester players TJ Warren and Chuma Okeke are also on New York’s radar.

Текст новости: Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid will miss the remainder of the regular season as he and the team continue to look for a long-term solution for a troublesome left knee that has plagued his season, the team announced. Embiid had increased swelling in the knee following a loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday night, and underwent a new round of imaging on Monday to determine why his knee has not responded well to the treatment protocols he has received this season. The 76ers and Embiid consulted with dozens of doctors and specialists to determine the best path forward for the 7-footer.

Текст новости: All season, Embiid has tried to play through pain in his knee, hoping it would improve as he got into better condition. He received numerous injections throughout the season, sources said, hoping to reduce the swelling and discomfort enough to enable him to play and be available for the 76ers. Instead of improving as he played more, the pain and swelling have increased. And in recent weeks, that has shown in Embiid’s and the team’s performance. Nonetheless, there were also stretches of the season when teammates and coaches would see Embiid perform well in practices, then sit out of upcoming games, sources said. His daily status appeared fluid all season, and it led to frustration among all parties.

Текст новости: Natalie Nakase knew she had the opportunity of a lifetime. After years of serving as an assistant coach — in the G League, NBA, and ultimately the WNBA — she had finally achieved a longtime dream of leading her own team. At last, the 44-year-old former UCLA point guard would be a head coach, selected to lead the WNBA’s incoming expansion team, the Golden State Valkyries. Nakase, who was previously an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers (2018-2020) and Las Vegas Aces (2022-24), has no shortage of experience on the bench. Under Clippers coach Ty Lue, she earned the respect of dozens of NBA players. Under the leadership of Becky Hammon, she won two WNBA championships alongside some of the best players in the sport. To this day, she credits Hammon for helping shape the WNBA into the league it is today — and for giving her a career-altering opportunity. Still, in the wake of her hiring in Golden State, there was someone else in the coaching world Nakase was eager to get to know: Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla, who just a few months earlier had become the youngest head coach in the NBA to win a championship since Bill Russell did so in 1968 at age 34.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: “My biggest thing was: how can I pick the brains of head coaches that win quickly?” Nakase told SB Nation in an exclusive interview. Nakase and Mazzulla had never met. But, the two shared a common background; both were undersized, tenacious guards on elite college basketball teams, Mazzulla at West Virginia (2006-2011) and Nakase at UCLA (1998-2003). Both later rose through the ranks in the G League. A close mutual friend also bound the two coaches: Celtics assistant coach Sam Cassell, who previously worked alongside Nakase on the Clippers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: From the moment Nakase met the Celtics’ head coach, his generosity struck her. “He was like, ‘What do you want to know? What questions do you have for me?’” Nakase recalled. “I’m like, ‘Are you for real? Like, aren’t you in-season?’ And he was like, ‘I got time.’” She was also struck by what she described as his “radical honesty” — whatever questions she had for him in those first few hours, he answered candidly, irrespective of how his answers might come off. “[He was] like, ‘this is me, this is who I am, and take it however you want,’” Nakase said. “And I think it’s kind of his mentality, right? Like, win-or-die.” Mazzulla provided blunt, honest answers to all of Nakase’s inquiries. As such, when she asked him about his playing career, he answered plainly: “I sucked.”

Текст новости: The Toronto Raptors are on the road without their resident grown-up, the most adult of the — in theory — adults in the room. As they make their way through Indianapolis and now Chicago and then four blissful days in Orlando, missing is 38-year-old Garrett Temple. His absence files firmly under “life stuff,” but in the very best category as Temple and his wife Kara, are expecting their third child any day now. Which raised the question: what would happen to the conga line? The what? The conga line. You see, at some point this season — and no one is entirely sure when — the Raptors’ many rookie reserves began lining up behind Temple, with hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them while dancing in the final moments before the tip like they’re about to snake around the tables at a wedding with a DJ cheering them on.

Текст новости: Fortunately this all happened organically, as in, no one planned it. “I just knew I was dancing,” Temple told me. “I was always dancing. And Jamal (Shead) started putting his hands on my shoulders, but I didn’t know it was an actual conga line until we were in (Atlanta) and (Lindsay Dunn of Citytv) showed me the video. I didn’t know everything that was happening behind me. I thought it was me and Jamal. I was so locked in.”

Текст новости: FIVE YEARS EARLIER, Altman had selected Garland with the No. 5 pick in the 2019 draft despite having only 4½ games of film to study from his freshman year at Vanderbilt, as a knee injury cut short his lone college season. It was a bet on the talent of a four-time state champion in high school who had wowed the Cavaliers’ brass with his skill in a private workout. That gamble on Garland paid off. He emerged as an All-Star as a 22-year-old in 2021-22, when he averaged 21.7 points and 8.6 assists as the young leader of a team that doubled its win total from the previous season, emboldening the front office to pull off a blockbuster trade for Mitchell in an attempt to expedite the process of building a contender in Cleveland. Garland put up similar numbers in his first campaign playing alongside Mitchell before his production dipped last season (18.0 PPG, 6.5 APG).

Текст новости: Throughout the second-round series, Boston’s big, physical perimeter defenders bullied Garland. His weight had dropped into the low 170s, about 20 pounds lower than normal, during the six weeks he spent sucking food through a straw while his jaw was wired shut after fracturing it in a Jan. 14 collision with Boston’s Kristaps Porzingis. “I’m getting beat up and getting pushed around out there,” Garland said. “I didn’t really feel like myself.” Garland’s offseason priority was filling out his physique again, not finding an escape route. “I wasn’t really too focused on all the trade talks and a lot of people saying all the other stuff about me,” Garland said. “Last year was just a tough year for myself, so I got away. I went out to L.A. just by myself almost damn near and just really locked in on my craft. “It really helped me just mentally and physically to just get a clear mind, not try to worry about what all the other people are saying and Twitter fingers. Just trying to work on myself and try to get back to where I was before.”

Текст новости: Mitchell could relate to how Garland felt after a disappointing playoff performance. He still winces when he recalls his second postseason in 2018-19, when he shot 32.1% from the floor while the Houston Rockets eliminated his Utah Jazz in five games. He vividly recalls being “locked up” by rugged Rockets defenders Eric Gordon, Luc Mbah a Moute and Trevor Ariza. “I think when you’re a young guy, you have to go through that season,” Mitchell said. “Everybody, every person will tell you they’ve had that season in their career, and it changes you. It changes you for the better. “I think everybody goes through that pivotal moment in their career. I don’t want to say he failed. He just hasn’t had as much success as he had really wanted in this situation. He fell short of that in his eyes, but also in everybody else’s. So now you come back and respond in this way. I think it’s perfect.”

Текст новости: There are many ways to measure success: financial goals, public adoration, mastery of a craft. There also is a marker few get to experience. It’s the moment of fame when a person can simply declare they want something, and somehow, it finds its way to them. Earlier this season, Jaylen Brown announced to the universe that he wanted to meet one of his idols. It wasn’t a fashion icon or a movie star. It was Bill Nye the Science Guy.

Текст новости: “A lot of people sent it to me: ‘Did you see Jaylen Brown’s tweet?’” Nye told The Athletic. “So, my people got in touch with his people, if I can use that expression, and I went to a Washington Wizards game, and we met in the tunnel, if I understand that correctly.”

Текст новости: As the crowd of about 175 people filled the cascading theater to watch the discussion, it quickly turned into Nye giving monologues about Brown’s decision to use the evening to shine a light on the importance of education. “To launch something at this capacity, you only get one shot, and I wanted to do my launch event and make it symbolic,” Brown said. “I created something and I got all these people here about something that just came from this brain. … Bill made that happen for me, so I’m forever grateful.”

That’s exactly what Bill Nye was doing,” Brown said. “I like to use my platform to show things that I think are more important. I get that sports is super important, but so is education. I use my platform to shine a light on that.”

Текст новости: While this spicy what-if scenario never gained any traction, league sources tell The Athletic that the Mavericks and Timberwolves informally discussed the prospect of swapping Dončić for 23-year-old, three-time All-Star Anthony Edwards in the weeks before the Lakers deal went down. More specifically, Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison reached out to the Timberwolves and asked if there was any chance they’d be willing to trade Edwards. He was promptly told no. The Timberwolves, league sources say, were stunned that Dallas was contemplating parting ways with Dončić.

The Lakers already attempted one — the rescinded trade for Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams — and will surely look at more moves this summer to bolster the Doncic fit. As for the Mavs, Harrison may be the target of plenty of criticism, but he has a devoted group of supporters that insist people should wait until Davis starts playing regularly and see how Harrison improves the roster this summer before passing final judgement.

Текст новости: In the days and weeks leading up to her team completing its deal to land superstar Luka Doncic, Los Angeles Lakers governor Jeanie Buss knew the importance of keeping trade talks with the Dallas Mavericks limited to as tight of a circle as possible. “It was really important to me that we didn’t blow up the team,” Buss said Thursday before the Lakers’ 111-102 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. “If it had leaked out and the trade hadn’t happened, that would be really unfair to the progress that the coaching staff had made with the team. Because it’s a huge distraction.”

Текст новости: “For ten years, these two leagues had no communication,” Motiejunas revealed. “In my 1.5 years as EuroLeague CEO, I haven’t met with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver even once.” “When I took over, I wanted to change that,” he said. “I had meetings with Mark Tatum and the head of NBA Europe, though the head of that position has since changed. But after a decade without dialogue, there is a lack of trust between us, which makes it difficult to make significant decisions together.” Motiejunas also disclosed that while the NBA had made an offer to the EuroLeague, the clubs ultimately rejected it, believing it was too early for such a major commitment. “We received an offer from the NBA, but the clubs didn’t agree to it because it was too soon for such a serious decision after having no communication for so long,” Motiejunas noted. “We are working step by step to build trust and find the best possible solutions for improving the overall situation,” he concluded.

Текст новости: I’m told it was an emotional meeting between Gregg Popovich and all of his players for the first time since he suffered the stroke in November. My understanding is that tears were shed because players saw their coach—who is clearly recovering from a stroke and still rehabbing—and they saw the physical signs of someone who has had, you know, hindrances, something clearly affecting him from the stroke.

Текст новости: This is someone in Gregg Popovich who wants to coach. He badly still wants to be out there, and that’s what players see—someone who had his life and his professional passion taken away. His joy for coaching. A lot of the meeting was also filled with classic “Pop” moments—motivational messages, wit, critiques, praise, and advice for players. But he made it clear: Gregg Popovich is not coming back this season. Mitch Johnson will be the coach for now, and Popovich’s NBA future remains uncertain.

Текст новости: Nae’Qwan Tomlin’s path to a 10-day contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers hasn’t been straightforward. He didn’t grow up on the AAU circuit like most pros but instead learned to play on the streets of New York City. Tomlin started playing organized basketball after high school, began his collegiate career at Monroe Community College, and played for four colleges in five years. It was an unconventional journey, to say the least, but one that Tomlin is glad he took. “Most definitely,” said Tomlin to Fear the Sword when asked whether that road has been beneficial for him. “Just from a maturity level. I was very immature early on. It just helped build character. Even when I was at Kansas State transitioning to Memphis, everything was just life lessons. It’s made me who I am today.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: This has all led to him being an NBA player. That’s something no one can take away from him. “I imagined playing, but that feeling when I get out there is surreal,” Tomlin said. “All that hard work that I put in and now I get to really step onto an NBA court. It’s amazing.” That hard work has been seen during his time with the Cleveland Charge, the G League affiliate of the Cavs. He’s averaged 15.7 points and 6.9 rebounds per game on .548/.361/.619 shooting splits. This has added up to an impressive 61.5 effective field goal percentage. Tomlin’s game is unorthodox for a 24-year-old 6’10” forward. His skills as an off-the-dribble scorer are impressive and not something you often see in a player of his size. How that translates to the professional game was unknown coming into this season. As a result, Tomlin began the year in a limited role. He played just spot minutes at the start but began to take on more responsibility once injuries forced him into the lineup a month in. His playing time doubled from November to December, as did his production.

Текст новости: But everything is working right now for the Warriors — Butler’s influence, Kerr’s rotations, the on-court rhythm and vibes. Kuminga is tasked with shedding his rust and regaining his traction without bothering the team’s momentum. That’s difficult. “The main thing I want for JK is to not press when he comes back,” Kerr said. “It’s not an easy spot to come back into where team’s rolling, contract stuff this summer. He’s going to have a lot on his mind. I want to make things as smooth and easy as possible. I want him to understand that it’s not going to happen right away. He was playing the best basketball of his career before the injury, and it’s not going to happen the first night where he’s going to get back to that level. It will take a little time.”

Kerr said he showed Kuminga clips of himself and also of Butler, believing the best version of Kuminga on the offensive end is similar to Butler’s. “He’s the perfect guy for JK to emulate,” Kerr said. “What makes Jimmy special is that he doesn’t try to be special. He plays fundamental basketball. He never turns it over. He just makes the simple play over and over. I want JK to learn some of that … attacking the rim, nothing there, jump stop, pass the ball. That’s a great basketball play. JK before he got hurt, it was the best I’ve ever seen him play. He was already on a great track. This was just a reminder that these are the things we want.”

Текст новости: The father of a young fan who received a game-used Victor Wembanyama jersey as part of a viral jersey swap has filed a request for a judicial intervention against Goldin Auctions to halt the sale of the item. Frankie Desideri Sr. filed the request for a temporary restraining order against Goldin with the New York Supreme Court on Monday. Desideri and representatives for Goldin are expected to meet in court Thursday morning. The jersey sold at Goldin for $73,200 on Saturday, two months after the original swap with Wembanyama. The jersey is believed to have been paid for and has been shipped to the winner.

Текст новости: Video of the jersey swap between 5-year-old Frankie Desideri Jr. and Wembayama went viral earlier this year, with the San Antonio Spurs official X account calling it the “best swap ever.” The swap was later met with criticism when the jersey, which was viewed as a gift from Wembanyama to the young Desideri, was sent to auction. According to the request, the family originally consented to auctioning the jersey, but later made multiple requests to have the item withdrawn, to no avail. Desideri told cllct his son had regrets and didn’t want to auction it off anymore.

Whether the property was Desideri’s or his son’s could he material to that claim. The family also claimed Goldin used images of Desideri Jr. and Sr. in promotional materials for the jersey despite an explicit request they not be included. The plaintiffs said Goldin’s use of their likeness without consent caused “widespread exposure and emotional harm.” Ken Goldin, founder and CEO of Goldin Auctions, said Desideri took the initiative to sell the jersey and not the other way around. “We never contacted this individual and never knew who he was,” Ken Goldin told cllct. “On Dec. 29, he contacted us first by going to Goldin.com and clicking the button that said ‘SELL.’ By Jan. 2 at 9:02 a.m., he had signed the consignment contract.”

Текст новости: With the trade deadline and “All-Star Weekend starring Kevin Hart” now in the rearview mirror, the NBA picture has come more into focus. The haves and the have-not-enoughs are clear. One league exec was on the line Tuesday to note his early call was still valid. “There’s no way you can look at the league now and say that Boston, Cleveland and Oklahoma City aren’t on a different level. I told you that almost two months ago,” he said. “The only way anything changes by the end of the season is injuries, but you’ve got to be looking at three of the four conference finals teams here. Those guys have separated themselves.”

Текст новости: New York is hoping the return of Mitchell Robinson helps, but can he be enough to dramatically impact the Knicks’ biggest area of concern: defense? In particular, transition defense. “KAT (Karl-Anthony Towns) isn’t in the kind of shape he needs to be to deal with Cleveland and Boston,” one league scout told Heavy Sports. “But this isn’t all on him. New York just doesn’t have enough good defenders. You know where you see it? (Jalen) Brunson’s out there working his ass off even though he’s got the size problem, and then you see other guys just getting beating up the floor and off the dribble.

Текст новости: As for the other club with Eastern Conference contender dreams at the start of the season, perhaps the less said about the 76ers the better. “What a mess,” said a front office source. “It all starts with (Joel) Embiid and what’s going on with him physically and otherwise, but take a step back and look at all the guys they’ve run through there in the last few years hoping something sticks. Harden, Jimmy Butler, now PG (Paul George)… that contract they gave Tobias Harris? “Teams around the league are looking at their roster now, wondering who they might be able to pick off around the edges, because it looks like they’re headed for some bigger changes.”

In all caps, Crowder quoted the tweet and wrote, “THAT TRU AND ONE DAY I OWE TO THE FANS TO EXPLAIN I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE AND THEY ASKED ME TO STAY HOME WHILE THEY TRADE ME.

Take it one game at a time, but we got to give ourselves a chance to see what we can do down the stretch.”

Текст новости: Make no mistake, the people who witnessed Doncic’s last days in Dallas do not paint a flattering portrait of the 25-year-old’s professionalism. They call him lazy. They talk about the weight issues that were such a frequent frustration within their walls. They mention the social habits that The Athletic has reported on — such as a taste for beer and hookah — which have been a point of concern for NBA types since he was a 19-year-old star for Real Madrid who was entering the draft. They predict his basketball demise, highlighting a health history that, as some see it, will likely lead to catastrophe in the next five years or so.

Текст новости: Dwyane Wade: I’ve said this before—this was the first moment I had an inkling that LeBron might not be coming back. One thing you don’t do is f*** with LeBron’s cookies. No, no, no, no. This is serious. He loves chocolate chip cookies—chocolate chip cookies and ice cream. That’s his thing. So, when he gets on the plane, Bron walks on with a bag of food. One bag is all cookies, and the other bag is what his chef has prepared for him. He eats a certain way. He don’t eat what’s on the plane. But he has his cookies. So, we get on the plane, and we play cards at the front. We’re playing cards, and at some point, Bron is going to be like, “Hey, bring me those cookies.” And one day, he was like, “Hey, where my cookies at?” They had to come up there and whisper to him—no more cookies on the plane. That man sat back. He pushed the table away. He sat there quiet, shaking his head. I was looking at him like, “He ain’t playing cards no more.”

And there’s an adage when you’re playing defense: Hey, if we’re physical and fouling all over the place, they’re not going to be able to call them all. And all credit to the league—you know, about a year ago, they decided they were going to allow more physicality. We like it too. We’re a defensive team, and we benefit from that. But then, when you have a player on the other end—Shai, who is so crafty and so hard to guard—he’s able to slow the game down in a way where everything’s focused on him. So, all the contact is kind of accentuated.

So, the bronzing process was even tougher on mine. The facial expressions, the details—they hardened even more. But when it’s still in clay, it’s soft. It looks more like your actual face. When I went through and looked at everybody’s statue, I told my team, “For some reason, when it comes to Black athletes, these statues don’t look like us.” It’s very hard to capture our features properly in bronze. But when I look at some of the other statues—of people who aren’t Black—it looks a little more accurate. So, I told them, “This can’t be about making it look exactly like me. This has to be about the moment, about the expression. When people pull up to my statue, they should know exactly what that moment was.”

Текст новости: The first game between the Mavericks and Lakers since the Luka Doncic trade delivered the top NBA audience on cable since Opening Night. Tuesday’s Mavericks-Lakers NBA regular season game, which marked the first time Lakers G Luka Doncic has played against his former team, averaged 2.5 million viewers across TNT and truTV — the largest NBA audience on cable since Opening Night. (Unlike the fully exclusive Opening Night games, TNT’s broadcast co-existed with local RSN coverage in Los Angeles.)

Текст новости: Viewership is iffy at best for the NBA, but attendance remains a robust story. After two straight seasons of record attendance (22.2 million in 2022-23 and 22.5 million in 2023-24) and season-ticket renewals, NBA EVP/Team Marketing and Business Operations Jonathan Tillman told me in San Francisco during All-Star weekend that the league is a three-pointer away from the prior two year’s pace — and that’s before any second-half playoff races. “By all indications, we should end up top three all time, at the very least,” Tillman said, crediting teams for marketing new and different partial season-ticket packages accounting for better retention rates.

Текст новости: With three German players — Franz Wagner, Mo Wagner and Tristan da Silva — the Magic last season hosted watch parties in the European country and have sent sales teams there several times. Martins said the team is close to signing its first deal of substance there — a multiyear, six-figure sponsorship. While the team hasn’t confirmed a game there yet, Martins is lobbying the league hard.

Текст новости: For the first time, city officials have put a projected price tag on a planned massive downtown sports and entertainment district that would be anchored by a new arena for the San Antonio Spurs. Not surprisingly, that price tag is in the billions of dollars. The Spurs arena will by far be the costliest of the facilities San Antonio officials envision as part of the project, with an estimated cost of between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, according to an agenda document posted ahead of a Wednesday briefing the City Council will receive on the district.

Текст новости: Malika Andrews on husband Dave McMenamin: He’s my best friend. He’s the person I go to for advice about everything—whether it’s professional, something with my family, or even something silly, like if I should keep doing a certain hobby. I don’t remember a time when he wasn’t all of that for me. So, I think it wasn’t this big, cinematic moment of staring into each other’s eyes—it was just… him. He’s the kindest person I know. He’s the smartest person I know. He’s the most considerate person I know. And somehow, in this big job and this big world, he still makes every single person around him feel like they are the most important person in the room. That’s something I’ve tried to learn from him—because the way he cares for his parents, the infinite patience he has for people, the way he shows up at work, and how he’s covered the league for so long at such a high level… I just really admire him. And not to mention—he has beautiful blue eyes. They’re really, really pretty.”*

Текст новости: But one potential obstacle for the Lakers is Hayes’ past legal troubles. Still, according to Jovan Buha of The Athletic, this should not be a concern for the team. “I don’t have any updates on the legal situation. It’s been dormant, to my knowledge,” Buha mentioned on his latest podcast. “So sure, I guess that that could be a fear, but I think it already happened, and he dealt with his punishment then. “There’s not been a second punishment, so I feel like something probably would have happened by now if it was gonna happen, but it’s been quiet. … For now, I’d tentatively say it’s not looking like it’s going to be an issue.”

Текст новости: In the summer of 2023, Ace and AJ went to Los Angeles and met with six agents in seven days. LeBron James even came along for the visit with Klutch Sports, the group that represents the Lakers superstar. But the Dybantsas left the city without an agreement, and Ace mostly continues to navigate the process on his own.

Текст новости: Bernardi says that in this era of NIL deals and increased competition for top high school talent, elite players essentially commit for a year and keep their options open beyond that. So it was no surprise when other programs began contacting Ace, who had some reservations about Prolific’s academic program and financial agreement, though he won’t go into detail. “I didn’t like the business part at Prolific,” Ace says now. “Let’s just leave it at that.”

He FaceTimed James, hoping his friend could share something about what had happened and why. “When it happened, I honestly didn’t know s—,” Davis recalled while standing in the hallways of Crypto.com Arena following the Lakers’ 107-99 win. “He’s been my running mate for six years … so the first thing I wanted to do was call him. … Obviously, I know there are going to be a lot of political things in the front office when they talk to me. “The front office has to do what it has to do and obviously they’re going to do what’s best for the organization. So I don’t know if I ever got the ‘real’ about any of it. I don’t know what’s true or what’s not, coming from upstairs. So, my thing is I’m gonna go to my counterpart who I’ve been running with and see what’s going on, get his reaction and that’s all it was. We had a conversation. That was it.

But the video was fire! The love from the crowd was fire! The ovation was fire! “I don’t know. I haven’t processed it. I might have to watch it again. I’m just in the midst of a game. I’m trying to win a basketball game. So, I couldn’t really get a chance to like, really, dissect the video and feel what I wanted to feel. But that’s the first time I had that, and I think that it was really dope for the Lakers to do, obviously, and I’m honored and appreciative, for them even considering to do that for me.”

I think if it was a playoff-type of thing, I may have tried to push through,” he said. “But the couple of games off definitely took me out of rhythm. It was hard to get back in shape. Especially after the break. I hadn’t ran at all for those three games I missed before the break, and then over the break, I didn’t run, so the first time I really ran was that first game back against (Charlotte). “Now I’m just kind of getting my wind back and getting my groove back. It’s still not ‘a hundred a hundred’ percent, but it’ll be back in probably the next couple of games.”

I don’t want that “OG, man, just come be one of the guys; we need your presence” type of role. Nah, I want to hoop. If I go out there, I want to be counted on to play minutes, you know what I mean?

Текст новости: Greg Oden: “I had a leg length differential my whole life. Basically, when I was in the sixth grade, my leg was falling out of my hip. When I went to get an X-ray, by the time I took the bus home, my mom literally picked me up from the bus stop by our house and drove me all the way back to the hospital. They said that if I had spent another day like that, my leg was going to fall out of my hip—that’s how fast I was growing. To this day, I still have two pins in my hip. Because of that, I used to always walk with a limp, and my body got used to it. When I got to Portland, I got orthotics that helped correct it, but I don’t think my body was used to the change. I swear to God, the next day after getting orthotics, my knee blew up. Probably a week later, I was having microfracture surgery—and that was the end of my rookie season.”

Текст новости: Former Lakers assistant coach Phil Handy provided further insight into James’ mentorship. “That was going back to Austin’s rookie year,” Handy tells me by phone this morning. “LeBron is one of those dudes that when he recognizes talent, especially in young players, he’s pretty hard on them. They’re learning on the fly, and he was tough on Austin because he saw his potential—how smart he was, how well he understood the game. He was just trying to elevate him. I always say that greatness pushes greatness.” Handy recalled that Reaves initially struggled with James’ demanding approach but had a perspective shift after their conversation.

Clark fully entered the Timberwolves’ rotation on Jan. 29, and he has averaged 6.9 points and 1.7 rebounds in 11 February games while shooting 47.4% from the field and 44% from 3-point land. He’s scored in double figures in three games, with 17, 14 and 11 points.

Текст новости: Windhorst spoke on The Hoope Collective about Doncic warming up an hour before Tuesday night’s game whereas he was practicing, Harrison was “sitting very leisurely on the scorer’s table.” He would say the two were about 15 or 20 feet apart from one another as the moment was bolstered as Windhorst was watching it with Doncic’s agent Bill Duffy who even called it a “special moment.” “Luka comes out to warm up an hour before the game give or take,” Windhorst said. “Nico is sitting very plainly in a sea of blue and gold, in a bright blue suit, sitting very leisurely on the scorer’s table when Luka comes out to warm up. They are 15 – 20 feet apart, Luka is shooting 3’s from the wing at one point, maybe 30 feet. I am sitting there watching it with Bill Duffy, who is Luka’s agent. Bill has been around the NBA for 40-plus years and he’s known Luka since Luka was 14 and he is just sort of watching with a smirk on his face. He’s like, ‘I’ve seen a lot of things in this league and this is a special moment.’”

Текст новости: But then its story is not so neatly canned. Its rise provoked larger questions about the sketchy state of sports fandom, the tussle between sentimentality and progress, and the reasons we value the things that we do. And its fall, well—it’s complicated. Four years on, Top Shot is still here, still fighting to reclaim its good name and cultural standing.  “We wanted to be a sustainable part of the fabric of the league,” says Roham Gharegozlou, the founder and CEO of Dapper Labs, which created Top Shot. “I think a hundred percent we can be and will be.”  But even if Top Shot can engineer itself for the future, it may always be best known for its past.

Текст новости: As interest picked up from crypto investors and the general public, Top Shot masterfully kept one foot in the shadowy Web3 world and one in the bright lights of the NBA, where users had their identities verified and mostly paid with credit cards, bypassing the crypto labyrinth. (The league’s legal department was “mega-involved” in the product’s development, Tedman says.)  “I started collecting Top Shot NFTs and I didn’t even realize they were NFTs at the time,” said the rapper Ja Rule, who later sold a $122,000 NFT commemorating the phony Fyre Festival, which he cofounded. “I just thought they were like the new digital sports cards.”

Текст новости: But if a brutal market correction was inevitable all along, and if Dapper Labs’ rollicking success depended on shaky external forces—all that only underscores the danger of contracts that “don’t make provisions for downturns,” as Tedman says, necessitating an endless peak.   “The cardinal sin in the deals was really the upfront guarantees,” says a former employee with knowledge of the terms. “To me, that was the sad part about it.”  Dapper Labs, like many NFT companies, cut its staff as prices tanked. It laid off 22 percent of its 600-plus employees in November 2022, 20 percent in February 2023, 12 percent in July 2023, and still more in 2024.  “They caught lightning in a bottle,” says one former employee, “and didn’t know what the fuck to do with it.”

He feels protective of Dončić. “I don’t think he expected the change and I think that’s probably what leads to him feeling his emotions even more so in a deeper way,” Irving said. “Rejection, I think that’s a strong word … but sometimes it can feel like that. “You got to go through your process of grieving. Grieving … is not a word we use in NBA circles — it’s like, ‘Just be tough, bro.’ Everybody expects you to turn over the next page and get over it. The reality is, man, we’re human too.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: The Lakers, meanwhile, believe that Dončić’s best is yet to come. That confidence, as I wrote recently, is inspired partly by the memories of legendary Lakers coach Phil Jackson and his philosophy that players don’t truly mature until their late 20s. And their front office, of course, is headed by someone who is as in tune with Bryant’s legacy as anyone — his longtime agent, Rob Pelinka. To put it bluntly, the vast majority of people I’ve spoken to within the league about this deal continue to believe that Dallas made a grave mistake. Especially considering how the 32-year-old Davis’ adductor strain, suffered just 31 minutes into his Mavericks tenure in a game against Houston on Feb. 8, only confirmed all those doubts about his reliability.

Текст новости: Yet to those who didn’t live through the Dončić experience — the front office executives, coaches and scouts who would love nothing more than to get their hands on a player of his ilk — all these justifications for the trade simply don’t compute. This is the NBA, where ego management has always been part of the equation and choir boys are hard to come by. Talent isn’t the end-all-be-all, but Dončić’s type — the transcendent kind — is so rare that it should be given every opportunity to be maximized. That’s how it was for the likes of Allen Iverson, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, Bill Walton and Larry Bird — all elite players who had their warts. That list is undeniably long, with very few able to meet the sort of standard set by Bryant or his idol, Michael Jordan (who had off-court issues of his own). As one league source put it while discussing these sorts of players, “You manage.”

Текст новости: Make no mistake, the people who witnessed Dončić’s last days in Dallas do not paint a flattering portrait of the 25-year-old’s professionalism. They call him lazy. They talk about the weight issues that were such a frequent frustration within their walls. They mention the social habits that The Athletic has reported on — such as a taste for beer and hookah — which have been a point of concern for NBA types since he was a 19-year-old star for Real Madrid who was entering the NBA Draft. They predict his basketball demise, highlighting a health history that, as some see it, will likely lead to catastrophe in the next five years or so.

Текст новости: The Lakers’ defense has somehow been better since Davis went down (and then was traded). Since his last game as Laker, Los Angeles is allowing just 105.9 points per 100 possessions, the best mark in the NBA. “Again, just team defense,” Redick said at practice. “Our group is committed to it right now. We have some good defenders, we have some really good defenders. … You have to play a team defense, and you have to rely on each other. And we’re doing that right now.”

Текст новости: Otherwise, it’s on to Boston for a big showdown with the Celtics, who are defending champs but are six games behind Cleveland for first place. Boston is 2-1 against the Cavs this season, winning once at TD Garden and once in Cleveland, on Feb. 4, which was the last one the Cavs lost. “The level of basketball they’re playing right now, statistically, they’re an NBA Finals team,” Orlando center Wendell Carter Jr. said.

Текст новости: The best and worst coaches at using challenges When it comes to the best coach in the league at using challenges, one stands above all others this season. It’s Tom Thibodeau of the Knicks, whose 79.4 percent success rate is the highest in the league.  Other coaches have lower success rates but have overturned more plays. These volume shooters include Nets coach Jordi Fernandez, Jazz coach Will Hardy, and Wolves coach Chris Finch, who all share the league lead with 32 overturned calls.  Erik Spoelstra, who is not a fan of the system, is at the opposite end of the spectrum. He is by far the stingiest coach with his challenges, using just 10 on the season. By contrast, Oklahoma City has used 57.

When the opportunity came up, we were not looking to move Anthony Davis. He was our rock-solid player, and we had to give up a lot to get Luka. I look back, and I remember the last time I saw Kobe alive—about a month before he passed. He had brought Gigi to a Lakers game to see Luka play because Luka was Gigi’s favorite player. The idea that Luka is now a Laker—I know how happy that would have made Kobe and Gigi.”

Текст новости: After unveiling their “Lake Show” City Edition uniforms in October, and debuting them on November 21st, the Los Angeles Lakers accumulated an abysmal 1-9 record in their (pretty awful) alternate uniforms. The Lakers were scheduled to play the New York Knicks on February 1st, in what was to be a matchup of two City Edition uniforms (I actually checked LockerVision before the game), and — thanks to a dispute between MSG Network and my local cable provider — was one of the few Knicks games I’d been able to watch this year since it was on ABC/ESPN. (Incidentally, that dispute was finally settled a couple days ago.) But I won’t soon forget it — it was a Friday night, and the Lakers did not come out in their CEs, but instead wore their “Statement” (purple) unis. The announcers made no mention of the uni switch, but we’d quickly learn the Lakers opted to go against the NBA’s uniform scheduling system, and did not wear their scheduled CEs. No reason was given at the time, but the maybe the Lakers, playing a marquee, nationally televised primetime game in Madison Square Garden, really wanted a “W” — and their 1-9 record when wearing CEs didn’t bode well in that department.

Текст новости: When Dončić returned to L.A. with a bit of a sunburn on his face, it wasn’t just from time spent on the beach. Lakers assistant coach Scott Brooks met him in Cabo and they worked out at a private, outdoor court for two hours a day, sources said. Dončić also supplemented the basketball drills by lifting weights in the gym at his hotel. Though Dončić did not publicly comment on the constant flow of leaks from the Mavericks organization disparaging his weight and conditioning, one source close to Dončić told ESPN the comments have served as a motivator. “A beast was awakened inside him,” the source said.

Текст новости: Recognizing their newest superstar was still “shell-shocked” by the trade, as one source described to ESPN, the franchise kept Dončić’s introductory news conference unusually basic. There are few things the Lakers do better as an organization than put on a big event, but instead of parading out Lakers legends in celebration, adorning the gym with purple and gold balloons, or snapping endless photos, Pelinka and Dončić sat alone on barstools in front of the rows of reporters, and fielded questions. Part of the reason why was because it was a game day. Later that evening, the Lakers were set to have their first game at Intuit Dome against the LA Clippers and so the team was already in game mode.

Текст новости: Averaging 11.3 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists while converting 37.4% of his 4.9 perimeter attempts per game, Jaylen Wells’ resume with the Memphis Grizzlies strongly supports his case for the 2024-25 NBA Rookie of the Year award. “I mean, I don’t really focus on it,” Wells told RG of the ROY race. “I’m focused on getting a championship. And if it just so happens… I feel like if I’m playing winning basketball, it should fall right into my hands. So that’s kinda how my mindset is.” The counting stats aren’t even telling the full story of his true impact.

Текст новости: It’s a phenomenon referred to as “the rookie wall.” However, Wells fights against that idea. “I don’t really believe in it. I just think there’s always gonna be ups and downs in any person’s season. So it’s just figuring out how to find a positive in all the negatives.” Durable and dependable, Wells has successfully evaded the assumptive lulls that have hindered so many who have been in his shoes, past and present. “Honestly, I think a lot of it came from going from D-II, just to be able to do it on my own in a lot of ways and having as many resources [in Memphis],” Wells said. “I did a lot of things on my own, just created my own routines. So being able to take those routines and use them on the road when we’re not in the facilities, I think that’s probably the biggest thing. I mean, I just love to play basketball, so any chance I can play, I’mma be out there.”

I asked multiple questions about the rehab process: Beede Question: “How is Jalen doing? I know he’s out tonight but what was he able to do this morning?” Mosley Answer: “Jalen was just able to do some running. Still no contact.” Beede Question: “How can you or the medical staff tell, regardless of Jalen, but when a player is ready for contact? What’s that process like?” Mosley Answer: “Again, everybody is different in how they respond to treatments, how they respond to the work that they’ve done that day. And so you really have to go off of their body of work. It’s … How does he feel in those moments and what can he push through? Where’s the pain tolerance? In a lot of ways, you’ve got to have great lines of communication with our guys and see how they feel after responding to what has happened.” Beede Question: “Has there been a setback or is this just something that takes time?” Mosley Answer: “This is something that takes time.”

Текст новости: When the rest of the world was dealing with the repercussions of the seismic trade that sent Luka Dončić from the Mavericks to the Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis, it couldn’t have been less on Wojnarowski’s radar. “I was going to bed and got a couple text messages from a couple people in the NBA. I looked. I saw it. I shut my phone off, and I went to sleep,” Wojnarowski said with a chuckle. “We had a big recruiting visit coming that I was planning … and that was my focus. “There’ll be other big trades and free-agent signings and hirings and firings, and I’ll be focused on my job.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: Between texts, calls, emails and social media, Wojnarowski went through his phones faster than the average person. But when it came time for a new phone, he was “negligent” about sending his old phone back in for a rebate. Thus, a stack of old phones piled up in his home office. It wasn’t until he dropped his final Woj bomb in September, announcing his retirement from ESPN, when the idea of selling his phones materialized at the suggestion of his agents. “I can’t tell you, it was by great design that I held on to them,” Wojnarowski said. “Because if I was really smart about it, I would have kept my Blackberries around.” One of the other reasons why Wojnarowski went through phones so quickly is that unlike many other news breakers in the industry, he didn’t use a second phone. He had a backup, as a precautionary measure, but seldom needed it. “Adam (Schefter) was really adept at using two phones,” Wojnarowski said of ESPN’s NFL reporter. “I was not adept at it. It always felt confusing to me.”

That lawsuit, filed last fall in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleged that the father-son Lakers teammates “negligently owned, controlled, repaired, entrusted, maintained and operated an automobile as to cause it to, and it did, become involved in an accident or collision,” causing injury to the plaintiffs and damage to the vehicle they were in.

Текст новости: It was Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka who also had head coach J.J. Redick on the line with a stunning message. Christie was told that he and nine-time NBA All-Star Anthony Davis were in a blockbuster trade to the Dallas Mavericks for five-time All-Star Luka Doncic. Christie’s call came about 15 minutes before the world found out. To say that Christie was emotionally affected by the news then and now is an understatement. “I had my suspicions when I got that call,” Christie, 22, told Andscape after a 126-102 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday. “The emotions at that moment obviously were pretty overwhelming. And then going back to the hotel room, I got zero seconds of sleep that night. I was up from 12 [a.m.] to 8:15 [a.m.] I had a flight the next morning at 8:30 to go to Dallas. I was in denial a little bit, at first. I can’t believe this is happening…

Текст новости: While tonight’s matchup could have a revenge type of feel for Doncic, Christie views it as a “homecoming game” that he wants to win. “I’m not even looking at this game as a ‘revenge game,’” Christie said. “I’m actually looking forward to it from a sense that I get to see old teammates, old colleagues, old coaches. I’m looking forward to just enjoying that game. I want to win, obviously. The Lakers are a playoff team. They’re really, really good. It’s a good test for us as a matchup, as a team as well.

Текст новости: Two Indiana Pacers fans have sued the Milwaukee Bucks and Patrick Beverley after the point guard threw a ball into the stands of Gainbridge Fieldhouse during an NBA playoff game last year in downtown Indy. In a lawsuit filed last Friday in Marion County Superior Court, two Pacers fans claim they experienced medical expenses, mental anguish, humiliation and lost wages after an incident during the 2024 matchup between Indiana and Milwaukee. The lawsuit names Beverley, the Bucks organization and former Milwaukee assistant coach Josh Oppenheimer as defendants. The suit stems from an incident between Beverley and the two fans during the fourth quarter of a Bucks’ 120-98 playoff loss to the Pacers on May 2, 2024.

Текст новости: The lawsuit claims that Simmons, her husband and at least two other fans were then escorted from the arena in a “perp walk” fashion, despite having done nothing to prompt Beverley’s actions. The fans were allegedly told by Gainbridge Fieldhouse staff to fill out written statements for security personnel, while Beverley and Oppenheimer were allowed to remain on the court. During this time, Simmons reportedly had trouble catching her breath and experienced other “significant physical symptoms.” EMS crews were called to the scene and allegedly concluded that Simmons’ blood pressure was “extremely high” and that she was distraught. As a result of the incident, Lanciotti and Simmons both reportedly suffered from the following: * Physical Pain and suffering; * Emotional and mental distress; * Humiliation, embarrassment and anguish; * Medical expenses; * Lost work hours/wages; * Compensatory and punitive damages.

Текст новости: For all the knocks he has received for lacking whatever it is, Tatum owns the richest contract in NBA history after signing a $314 million extension with the Celtics last summer. He is in Gatorade commercials, has his own Jordan Brand signature shoe, is third in jersey sales and finished third in all-star fan voting (well ahead of James, Durant and Curry). He also plays for one of the league’s most storied franchises — one that has stayed relevant since he first put on its uniform in 2017 and secured an NBA-best 18th title last season with him at the helm. “Honestly, no,” Tatum said when asked whether he feels appreciated for what he has done. “If you took the name and the face away from all my accomplishments and you’re just like, ‘This is what this Player A accomplished at 26,’ people would talk about [me] a lot differently.”

Bryant, Tatum’s favorite player growing up, ceded Finals MVP honors for his first three championships to Shaquille O’Neal. Curry wasn’t the Finals MVP until his fourth ring, which came at Tatum’s expense. Tatum said he believes that 2022 NBA Finals loss to Golden State is used as a massive demerit when considering his stature within the game. “I didn’t play at the capability that I know I can, and I own that I didn’t do enough for us to win,” Tatum said. “Getting there at 24, I think people would look at me a lot differently had I won that championship. But I feel like that’s held against me a lot, still, even a few years later, even after winning the championship. But that’s something I got to get past.”

Текст новости: Teammates say Keefe has made a gargantuan difference in Poole’s performance, in part because Keefe has continued to demand a lot from Poole. “It’s hard to manage a team and put the ball in your hands all the time. Jordan being that for us is going to help him become a better player in the long run,” swingman Corey Kispert says. “I think (Keefe) wants us to play a style that benefits Jordan: fast-paced and things like that. Also, he challenges Jordan all the time. He calls Jordan out all the time. He pushes him to be better all the time. So, that kind of accountability — when you come from a place that B.K. comes from — when you’re speaking to somebody, it pushes you to be a better player, and I’ve seen Jordan grow because of it.”

Текст новости: There’s a reason Anthony (whose primary purpose in life seems to be to make his close friends, a group that includes both Houstan and Carter, uncomfortable for his own entertainment) was insistent that a dunk whose existence remains in question actually occurred: Houstan, a 6-foot-8 hustler, is the tallest qualifying player (500 minutes played) currently in the NBA who has never dunked in-game. He can do so in other settings. He dunked in college. He’s done it in open gyms. And according to Anthony, he once brutalized Carter in a scrimmage, even if Anthony, known best for his practical joking, seems to be the only one who recalls the moment. “Caleb ain’t never dunked on me,” Carter said. “That’s cap.” The center who has played with Anthony for five seasons and Houstan for three couldn’t help but laugh. This, he declared, was just his bud being a “chatterer,” as always. “He’s just always chatting. … He’s from New York,” Carter said, chuckling at Anthony’s attempts to spread what he called lies. “You know how that s— goes.”

Текст новости: Despite the expected growing pains, Philadelphia 76ers star Paul George is a believer in the James-Doncic pairing due to their basketball intelligence, via Podcast P with Paul George: “I think it’s gonna work on the simple fact that both of those two are high-level IQ players,” George said of the James-Doncic pairing. “They understand spacing. They understand pick and roll. They see plays two, three plays ahead. They know how to manipulate the defense. They’re both obviously great with the basketball in their hands. I think that’s an area Luka can probably be better at is playing with the ball out of his hands, so that’ll be an adjustment I think for him as well as probably LeBron, you know? LeBron is a basketball-dominant player. Obviously, he can play off the ball as well. And I think that was the reason Luka was brought over so that Bron can be off the ball a little bit more and not have to make all the plays.”

Текст новости: On April 29, Quaintance committed to Arizona State, a team coming off a 14–18 season that had made the tournament just five times in the past 20 years, never advancing beyond the second round.  But the Sun Devils had something those other programs lacked: a high-six-figure donation from NBA superstar James Harden to his alma mater’s Sun Angel collective, Front Office Sports has learned. Harden’s two-year college career came well before college athletes could legally earn money for their NIL (name, image, and likeness), but now he’s involved in helping his school compete with the big boys for top talent. Adding Quaintance helped the Sun Devils sign a top-10 recruiting class heading into this season.

Текст новости: Harden knows his approach stands out from many of his peers. He spends offseasons in Scottsdale, works out at the university, and enjoys being on campus 16 years after being a student. “NIL nowadays is the most important thing, because kids want to be compensated for their play and their work, which makes sense,” Harden said. “I wanted to be a part of helping the team and the school get players … and if NIL is the problem, then I can help with that.” It’s clear that players like Harden view the returns on their investment differently. Hawks guard Georges Niang has contributed $100,000 annually to Iowa State’s We Will collective since NIL became legal in 2021, and he’s happy to try to help fund his alma mater’s success. Even so, he’s aware of the downside of his decision.

One source called the procedures “radical” in light of the mundane injury and surgery that brought Embiid to this point. For some reason, what should have been a routine rehab and a routine return to play has gone horribly wrong.

Parekh also does not treat Embiid, but a Sixers source said there is no evidence that the sprain affected the knee either immediately after the sprain (he played in five of six games immediately after the injury) nor since it healed.

You’ve been through injuries, you’ve had surgeries, and obviously, it’s still a nagging issue. Now, it’s about holding yourself accountable—go lose 40 pounds. Obviously, your body can’t sustain that type of weight. The wear and tear, the constant pounding on your knees night after night—it’s not going to help your situation. Go lose 40. Forty. Forty. I think you should lose 40. Being at that size and weight— in the league today—it doesn’t really help you. You don’t have to go out there and be this huge, physical guy anymore. This is a rail-thin league. It’s about moving up and down, side to side. It’s not about physicality and bruising. So, go lose 40. I think he still remains a dominant player. He’s more of a finesse, jump-shooting big at this point in his career. Losing that 40 helps—it improves his quickness, his explosion, and his ability to get up and down the court.

Текст новости: Nikola Jokic had a career-best 19 assists while adding 18 points and nine rebounds, Aaron Gordon scored 25 points and the Denver Nuggets defeated the Indiana Pacers 125-116 on Monday night. According to ESPN Research, Denver’s win marked Jokic’s 28th career game with at least 15 assists, the most by a non-guard in NBA history. His final total is also tied for second most in a game by any center in the league’s history. Only Wilt Chamberlain, according to ESPN Research, has had more, posting 21 assists against the Detroit Pistons back in 1968.

Текст новости: Sources around the league are paying close attention to the valuation of the winning bid. The record sale price for the controlling stake in an NBA team remains the $4 billion Mat Ishbia paid for the Suns two years ago. The Celtics’ final sale price could factor into potential NBA expansion, sources said, with several anticipating that process not beginning before the sale of the Celtics is concluded. Longtime Wolves owner Glen Taylor and potential new owners Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez have been in a protracted battle for control of the team.

Текст новости: Former NBA player Michael Carter-Williams is hoping to get a WNBA franchise in Boston whether it’s through expansion or being a destination for a current team that wants to move. He’s part of The Boston Women’s Basketball Partners group that is spearheading the initiative. The group hasn’t submitted a bid to the WNBA although they’ve talked with the company that the league hired to handle the expansion bids process. “The main objective is to get a team in Boston,” Carter-Williams said in a phone interview Thursday. “It doesn’t matter if it’s an expansion team or a team that wants to sell and move to Boston.”

Текст новости: The NBA eventually will huddle up with its newest media partner, NBC (which has rights to All-Star Games going forward), and formalize a plan. Sources said one possibility for 2026 is a four-team tournament consisting of one squad of International All-Stars, which would conceivably be Antetokounmpo, Wembanyama, Nikola Jokic, Luca Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam and Kyrie Irving (who will have Australian citizenship). Two other teams would be made of U.S.-born all-stars, and a fourth team — instead of a Rising Stars winner — could be a team of All-Star snubs, who’d have everything to prove. This year that might have included Domantas Sabonis, Devin Booker, Tyrese Haliburton, De’Aaron Fox, Jimmy Butler and Tyrese Maxey.

These are people who have been called “nerds” or “weird” for liking LEGO, and they took all that heat. Then a celebrity shows up, and suddenly, it’s cool? That’s why I made sure to respect the space.

Doc Rivers told him, “Man, you will never play another game in a Celtics uniform.” Damn. He played too much. Nate Robinson was that type of guy, man—listen. Nate Robinson was the type of dude who, if you left something in the locker room, he’d take your outfit and put it up on the board. Right there—where the matchups, the opponent’s plays, and the game diagrams were. And right underneath it, he’d write: “Who the hell wore this?” with an arrow pointing at the outfit. Guys would go get their shots up, come back, and see their outfit on display. By the time they got to their locker, they’d be looking around like, “Man, what the hell?”

This gives Williamson more of an opportunity to make an impact. “It definitely gives me an advantage because, especially with KO (Olynyk) out there now, because if you stick a small on him, he’s just going to duck in,” Williamson said. “He also has a perimeter game where you can’t just sag off him. You have a big lineup and I’m able to get downhill, when I get a pass off, they can finish.”

Zeller is in the first year of a three-year, $11 million contract, the final two years of which are non-guaranteed. Houston’s brass opted against making any major moves around this season’s trade deadline, but Zeller’s contract could be useful to match salary if the front office decides to become aggressive on the open market.

Текст новости: As a member of the San Antonio Spurs, Harrison Barnes finds himself surrounded by young, hungry players eager to learn and grow. One of the standout features of the current Spurs roster, according to Barnes, is the willingness of the young guys to absorb lessons from the veterans around them, including him and fellow veteran Chris Paul. “The thing that surprised me about our situation is that all the guys here listen and want to learn,” Barnes says, referring to the strong sense of camaraderie within the locker room. “A lot of times people assume that we’re in the locker room and we don’t hear what they’ve got to say and that’s not the case.”

Текст новости: Barnes admits that as a young player, he was simply trying to make it in the league, focusing on improving his game and adjusting to the demands of the NBA. However, the lessons from these veterans about family, finances, and maturity weren’t lost on him. “That helped my development just understanding different sides of things and understanding how to raise a family; having a wife and two kids and just having those conversations really helped me with my development,” he says, highlighting how much those moments shaped his off-the-court growth.

A familiar sense of viability has returned. “I just know what it looks like,” Draymond Green told The Athletic when asked to explain his proclamation. “This team all year has been kind of like, ‘Man, we’re right there, but can’t quite get over the hump.’ But there’s a reason that you feel like you’re right there, but can’t quite get over. And the reason I think we all thought we couldn’t quite get over was because there was a missing piece. That piece isn’t missing anymore. That piece is him.”

I think we needed a little more to get over the hump. You combine those two together, and this one guy with an undying passion and wants to win a championship. It’s like burning for that.”

Текст новости: In a statement to the Journal Sentinel, Porter’s attorney Phillip Jobe said, “Mr. Porter successfully complied with all terms of his plea agreement. As a result, on January 23, 2025, the New York court vacated his prior plea to a misdemeanor, leaving only the harassment violation, which is not a crime. “Mr. Porter accordingly has no criminal record from this case.”

Текст новости: Once those talks ultimately fizzled, thanks largely to Durant’s disinterest in that reunion, Minnesota’s own approach for Durant was serious enough, sources say, that the Timberwolves were calling rival teams over the final few days before the Feb. 6 deadline buzzer sounded. The Wolves were working the phones in hopes of finding avenues to get under the NBA’s second luxury tax apron and then be able to aggregate contracts, all with the intent of landing Durant and his $51 million salary this season next to his Olympic running mate Anthony Edwards.

Текст новости: Instead, Brown hopes 741 can disrupt the status quo of the sneaker industry and how business is done more broadly. He believes that decentralizing power structures in fashion, sports, and beyond is an inescapable truth for the future, and something Brown hopes to advance. In outlining that vision, Brown evoked activist Fred Hampton. “One of my favorite quotes from Fred Hampton is, ‘You can kill a person, but you can’t kill an idea,'” Brown said. “The idea I’m speaking to right now is decentralization. And it’s already here.” “Decentralization is here, but why not the shoe industry? Why not every industry? I’m challenging everybody to continue this trend and continue this journey. It’s a new world,” Brown said.

Draymond Green: I believe we got the pieces to do it, and like I said, I know what that looks and feels like, you know what I’m saying? A lot of people are like, “Oh man, how is he going to say that? He ain’t done it.” What they say—”How you gonna talk about how to do it if you’ve never done it?” You got all these people out here talking about what I said and how I’m gonna do it, but I’ve done it before—over and over and over.

If you don’t love, eat, and breathe this—and, more importantly, winning—you can get frustrated with that. I can see, in two or three weeks—whatever it’s been—how someone could get frustrated with Jimmy. Because most people aren’t winners.

I can see how they could get shell-shocked and be afraid of that. In that moment, Jimmy was drawing up a play for us. With our team, there are a lot of denials, a lot of traps trying to take Steph out of the game. He was showing us a different way to run a set to get him in a certain position that would open things up.

Текст новости: Draymond Green on Oscar Robertson’s comments: I thought those comments were very interesting. The Big O is 86 years old—respect your elders. So, if you think I’m going to come over here and disrespect him because there was disrespect on that, that ain’t how I roll. I’m never going to disrespect one of the pioneers of the game because he shared that opinion. Quite frankly, being great at something when skill is involved doesn’t necessarily mean the knowledge matches the greatness of that skill. And I think in basketball, that’s often misconstrued. You see a guy with great skill, and you think, “Yo, that guy’s got great skill.” In turn, you give that guy respect because of the skill, but the knowledge ain’t really there. That happens all the time in what we do.

In the year that Big O won a championship when he was starting to age, you were passing the ball to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar himself. Not quite sure where the dig came from. I was also extremely surprised, BD, because during the skills challenge that I blew, I saw him on the sideline. I got up from my seat, went and said hello, and he’s like, “Hey man, you still out there doing it? Keep on going. I love watching you play, man. I just love watching you play. You keep going.” And so, to hear him say that, and then the next morning, he completely flipped and went opposite—I was a little surprised by that, I must say. Because it wasn’t quite the same when I saw him.

After the game, he acknowledged the Suns’ struggles, pointing to their inability to contain opposing teams’ scoring runs as a key issue. “We had these little spurs where each team would go off and go on a flurry on us, and that’s usually the game. Going on a 12-0 run or 19-5 runs,” Durant said. “We’re playing good ball, and then to give up a run like that. It’s tough to fight back when teams score that many points in a row.”

Текст новости: Myles Turner: So, one of the first people to give me advice coming into the league was Chris Bosh, a Hall of Famer. He told me, “When you come into your funds, it’s gonna be easy for you to go blow it on cars, jewelry, houses, and stuff like that.” But he advised me, “Get with a good financial advisor, get with a good lawyer, and make sure your money is working for you.” One of the first things I did was invest in some land in rural Texas. I also invested in the stock market, contributed to my retirement, and put money into some buildings and real estate. The advice I give to anybody coming up is to try to save that first check as much as possible. My 19-year-old mind wasn’t really thinking that way, but I got some really good advice, and I was able to make solid investments that still benefit me today.

Текст новости: The Sixers are still hopeful that they can avoid additional surgery on Embiid’s knee, per multiple team sources and sources familiar with the situation. Embiid’s surgery on his left meniscus in February 2024, after Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga fell on his leg, did not result in all of the meniscus cartilage being removed. The hope over the past several months has been to try to find ways to reduce Embiid’s symptoms, because there had been no indication or belief that additional surgery would “fix” Embiid’s knee. Indeed, there was belief that continuing to play would be more beneficial than shutting him down.

First was when Michael Bloomberg, reportedly worth more than $100 billion, joined Lore and Rodriguez to infuse cash for ownership. Secondly, last fall while the arbitration hearing was underway, Taylor’s lawyers quietly subpoenaed the NBA for records and assorted documents, which couldn’t have delighted the league.

Текст новости: Channing Frye: Nostalgia is killing the NBA. The ’90s basketball era with Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant was not as clean as you think. Y’all forget that Jordan left the league for two years. Y’all forget that Kobe—rest in peace—quit on his team in the playoffs and refused to shoot the basketball. So all this talk about Kobe, Jordan—”Oh, he’s not this, he’s not that”—it’s propaganda. Every great player, whether it’s Ant, Wemby, LeBron, Steph—whoever—gets compared to players from 40 years ago. But the rules weren’t even the same back then! You’re not really watching help-side defense. Who’s doing what? What are these rules? Nobody celebrates the new generation of players. So why would anyone want to be the face of the league when every network constantly criticizes them for not being like someone from 40 years ago? It’s ridiculous. It’s unfair. LeBron is one of the greatest players ever. Stephen Curry is one of the greatest players ever. Giannis is one of the greatest. Jokic—same thing. Yet we just keep talking about Michael Jordan.

That 53-point win was the largest in franchise history, surpassing the 50-point margin Portland put up against the Cleveland Cavaliers back in 1982. And it came from a team that only improved to 24-33 with the victory (albeit, one playing a team that dropped to 14-41 with the loss), leading to headlines like “Trail Blazers, of all teams, win by 53 points for largest victory in franchise history” (from Fox Sports). But Alberta Basketball communications coordinator and long-time NBA journalist Brian Swane had a particularly interesting point after this on how these 50-point blowouts are way more common than they’ve ever been: NBA games decided by 50+ points: 2020s – 19, 2010s – 8, 2000s – 6, 1990s – 7, 1980s – 6, 1970s – 9, 1960s – 3, 1950s – 0, 1940s – 0. There have been 11 games decided by 50+ points since the start of the 2023-24 season.

Текст новости: That’s right; the NBA had never seen double-digit 50-plus point blowouts in a decade until the 2020s, and then got 11 over just the past season and a half. Also, five of the top 12 trouncings of all time by victory margin came this decade, with three of those coming since the start of the 2023-24 season. And games that lopsided often make for bad television (although they sometimes come with entertaining announcer diversions, as we saw with Fox’s college basketball trouncing Saturday night), and they definitely lead to people tuning out earlier and thus decreasing the average minute audience.

Текст новости: But there he was early Saturday evening, trying to reflect on a sixth straight loss for the Bulls, as well as his own present and future. “It was kind of like, ‘OK, what happens with me?’ “ Vucevic said. “The front office picked a direction, and now at this point of the season we have what we have. I was a little out of my rhythm, but I feel like I’ve found a few things the last couple of games, but I still need to play better than I have. You just got to stay a pro no matter what is going on.”

Текст новости: The Bulls did get in discussions for Vucevic with several teams, including Golden State, but when the Heat finally opted to move off Jimmy Butler, the Warriors turned their attention in that direction. The deadline came and went, and of the Bulls’ version of the “Big Three,” only Vucevic remains. “You have to do your best to be there for your teammates,” Vucevic said of his mindset. “We’re still playing for something. We’re still in that play-in hunt. Obviously, it was very disappointing to see Zach go. Me being the last of the ‘three’ that were here, and the other guys as well, this is the way it works in this business. It was tough for a little bit when he got traded.”

Текст новости: Sunday marked the two-month anniversary of Miami Heat guard Dru Smith’s latest setback, suffering a season-ending torn Achilles tendon during a Dec. 23 win over the Brooklyn Nets. Over the last two months, Smith has experienced the various stages of grief. “It was very, very unfortunate,” Smith said in his first comments to the media since the injury. “It was tough for those first couple days, first week or so just trying to process it all. I felt like I was in a really good spot, things were going well. So in a sense, it felt like something was taken from me. But it really wasn’t. It was just something that I had to process and move on after that.”

It’s the first time that Smith has traveled with the Heat since going down with his Achilles injury. “Just a little bit easier to get some work in with [Heat Senior Director of Rehabilitation] Jeff Ruiz,” Smith, 27, said of joining the Heat on the road. “It’s always good to get out and be with the guys, and just be here to support.” Heat coaches and players also enjoy having Smith on the road. “We love having him around,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “This was really for him to come on the road trip and get out of the building, lift his spirits up.”

Текст новости: Now, Smith is left rehabbing from a significant injury for the second time in the last year after also sustaining a season-ending knee injury in November 2023 last season. He was cleared to resume full-contact basketball after that setback when the Heat opened training camp in October, only to suffer this latest season-ending Achilles injury in December. “I’m going to say this is my least favorite of them all,” Smith said when asked to compare the rehabs for both injuries. “This has been the toughest one, I would say. Probably because it’s also coming right off of another major rehab. So that kind of made it worse. And also it’s just a much slower process at the beginning. So just been kind of having to be really patient. I feel like I’m taking things slowly, but it’s just the pace that you kind of have to move at.”

Текст новости: It is common to see NBA players vacation in the offseason in Mexico, the Caribbean and popular European destinations to unwind. Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is far from common. This past offseason, the 2024 NBA Finals Most Valuable Player decided to rest his body and mind in the Kingdom of Bahrain. “I went there just for privacy, peace of mind,” Brown, 28, told Andscape. “Just also to learn about different places in the world, just exploring, making relationships with their foundations, exploring relationships through the game. You can help develop other areas. “I had never been there before. It’s like a small island, not too far off the coast of the UAE [United Arab Emirates], not too far from Dubai and Qatar. I just enjoyed it. I spent the summer away outside of the U.S. [It was a] Different experience for me. It kind of opens your eyes to different parts of the world.”

But after making one short trip after winning the 2024 NBA title with the Celtics, he loved it so much that he went back. He enjoyed his privacy being respected, meeting some of the country’s brightest minds, and the beauty and culture during his lengthy stay in Manama. “I learned a lot. I learned about their ethics, the values,” Brown said. It’s a lot different from the U.S. Just different things that they emphasize are different than the things that the U.S. emphasizes. They definitely have a culture that they want to maintain and I respect it… “The most beautiful part was all of it was the views, being in the water. It’s not too far from Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The whole experience was nice.”

Me as a trainer, he elevated my mind. I’m going hard as a trainer and then he says, ‘Did you check in with your kids and wife?’ He cares about you as a person. That’s why I love him. He’s also not self-centered. He was about empowering me and my brand. Putting me in position to win. “He’s an NBA player helping me with ideas to help my family. He helped me as a person. I consider him one of my best friends. When I was around him, it’s not just about basketball with him. It’s about life.”

For Middleton, who, for the first time since the trade, spoke one-on-one with The Athletic following the Wizards’ shootaround on Friday morning, playing for a team other than the Bucks and working through the emotions that come along with such a move is something he is still trying to process. “Yeah, it’s a range,” Middleton said of the emotions he continues to feel after the trade. “Like, it’s a cycle I go through a lot of times. I’m trying to get out of that cycle now because it’s over with, and there’s no point of really going down that path. But definitely anger. Definitely, like sadness. Like denial, ‘Why would they do that?’ Questioning their decision and stuff like that. “But I think it’s healthy for me to think about all that stuff and try to bottle that and put that into something positive. And for me, that’s starting here. That’s helping these guys get their building blocks and helping them grow this organization like I did with the Bucks.”

I mean, I gotta keep doing my job. I need to focus on what I need to do every day to go out there and perform until I get that phone call. That’s the mindset I tried to take because it could be a distraction. I mean, you can go out there, cause hell, be a cancer in the locker room, especially when things aren’t going your way, but that’s not right. Be professional, be a teammate, brother, friend. So just try to not see it, try to ignore it as much as I could and focus on what I needed to do.

He kept rolling from there — and so did the Lakers — as Doncic finished with a game-high 32 points in a 123-100 win that gave L.A. its first victory in Denver in nearly three years. “It’s very tough to play here against that team,” said Doncic, who added 10 rebounds, seven assists and four steals in his fourth game with L.A. since being traded earlier this month. “Just to win like that, it’s an amazing win for us and gives me a lot of confidence moving forward.”

And Bron and AR, because we’re gonna stagger everybody, they’re gonna have their times to be on the ball.” His full response: With the ball movement tonight, it felt like you guys generated a ton of open looks. Even in the first half, you guys missed a bunch and were still up relatively big. Was tonight kind of your vision for the offense and a preview of what this group can do as they build on this? JJ Redick: Yeah, I think Luka needs to be the guy that controls the offense. And Bron and AR, because we’re gonna stagger everybody, they’re gonna have their times to be on the ball. But all three of those guys are very intelligent basketball players and we can create mismatches. We can get teams in the blender. And a lot of times, that’s how we were able to generate, I thought, some great looks in the first half. Made some early and then we went cold. We felt like we were getting good offense throughout that first half.

Текст новости: Nic Claxton’s layup beat the buzzer — and beat the 76ers, 105-103, on Saturday night in a play he called one of the highlights of his career. The Nets center put back a Keon Johnson miss, an acrobatic shot that just barely beat the clock and subsequently saw him “mobbed” by Ziaire Williams, Trendon Watford and the rest of the Nets before a stunned sellout crowd of 20,431. “Originally, I didn’t even know that I did beat the buzzer, so I was just trying to process everything, and I was just looking in the crowd, just looking around. And I was like, ‘I think it was good.’ And everybody came and just mobbed me. It was a great feeling, a great feeling,” said Claxton. “It’s definitely top three [moments of my career]. All the years I’ve been hooping, it’s definitely three or two.”

Текст новости: Trendon Watford had 11 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, logging 9:14 in the final period as the only Net with a positive plus-minus in the final stanza of a 105-103 win over the 76ers. “It’s time to win. I mean, Jordi [Fernandez] told me I was pretty much gonna finish the game. So, fourth quarter, it’s time to win. We all just knew we had to win that quarter to win the game,” Watford said. “Man, I’m so glad we ain’t have to go to overtime. Honestly, I ain’t know if I had it in me to play five more minutes, I ain’t gonna lie.”

Текст новости: New York sports fans who subscribe to Optimum can finally rejoice. MSG Networks was back on Altice-owned Optimum in time for Saturday’s Rangers-Sabres game after the two sides came to a new agreement to put MSGN’s channels back on the airwaves. Optimum stopped carrying Knicks, Rangers, Islanders and Devils games for its estimated 1 million New York City-area customers on Jan. 1. After weeks of fighting, the two sides reached a multiyear deal that gives Optimum the ability to sell lower-priced packages without MSG, which was on its basic tier, a source told The Post. MSG Networks is lowering the price it charges Optimum per subscriber from about $10 to $8, the source said.

Текст новости: A one-of-a-kind Victor Wembanyama rookie card sold for $860,100 on Saturday night, setting a new record for one of his trading cards despite his season-ending injury being announced earlier in the week. Wembanyama’s 2023 Panini Prizm Nebula Choice 1/1 card was sold at auction by Goldin. The final sale exceeded the previous record for a Wembanyama card — his 2023 Prizm Black Shimmer 1/1 rookie card, which sold for $516,000 last April — by a considerable margin, particularly notable given the uncertainty around his health.

Текст новости: The latest sale suggests that Wembanyama’s high-end card collectors remain bullish on the 21-year-old’s long-term career prospects even after Wednesday’s news that his season is likely over due to a blood clot in his right shoulder. When the news was first reported mid-day on Thursday, bidding was at just over $400,000 (including the buyer’s premium). Following the announcement, it more than doubled to set a new record.

Текст новости: Curated by Parisian Stéphane Ashpool, in collaboration with creative brands Pigalle and Ill-Studio, Pigalle Duperré sits between a high school and a residential building. Its court patterns, built with rubber panels from recycled soles of old shoes to withstand all weather conditions, have regularly changed colors and appearances over the years. It’s become a must-stop for visitors, regardless of if they care for basketball. Ashpool said it’s been a viral topic of discussion since 2015. How viral? Pigalle Duperré has a 4.5-star rating from more than 550 reviews on Google Maps. One reviewer described it as an “excellent example of urban regeneration and a good use of urban voids.” Another called it the “most vibrant and colourful basketball court probably on Earth.” “We know it is a place now that is in a lot of tourist books,” Ashpool, 42, told The Athletic. “People are coming from all over the globe daily.”

Текст новости: Can there be an NBA equivalent to the 4 Nations? “I don’t know what the format would be,” said Lauri Markkanen, who sported Finland’s 4 Nations jersey walking into a Jazz game last week. “Would it be the World against the US or North America? Is it going to be France? I think (the 4 Nations) is a really good format, and it’s meaningful games for the break. You always want to fight for your country, so it’d be cool.”

Текст новости: You could have Team USA, Team Canada, Team Europe and Team Africa and then use the same format as the 4 Nations Face-Off (a round robin and then a final). Markkanen, at least, thinks something like that would work — especially because he’d feel a similar pride representing a European squad as he does putting on a Finnish jersey. “Not quite the same, but like it’s up there for sure,” he said. “It’s like a brotherhood. You see a European guy on the other team, you talk with them after the game, and it’s almost like you know each other and you’re from the same country. You’re not, but just sharing something coming to the States. And I think it’s a thing that connects people. So definitely we feel prideful representing Europe.”

Текст новости: Center Jarrett Allen hurt his right hand at some point in the first half of Cleveland’s 142-105 rout of the New York Knicks on Friday night, an injury that could leave the NBA’s top team without one of its key players. Allen is expected to undergo an MRI on Saturday, an off day for the team. The Cavs, who improved to a league-best 46-10 with their most-lopsided win ever over New York, host the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday. Allen played just a few minutes in the second half before the Cavs announced he would not return. “X-rays were negative, so that’s good,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “I do think he’s going to get an MRI tomorrow. He came up to me during the game. He goes, ‘It’s really bothering me. I’m not going to be able to finish.’ But good X-rays were negative.”

Текст новости: Allen was reluctant to discuss his injury when he was approached in the locker room following the game. The affable Allen, who did not have a wrap on his hand, did offer that he may have gotten hurt while trying to block a shot in the first quarter. “He’s fine,” chimed in All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell, who scored 27 points in 26 minutes. Allen’s injury comes just as the East-leading Cavs were getting back to full strength. Forward Dean Wade returned against the Knicks after missing several weeks with a bone bruise in his knee, and forward Isaac Okoro came back Thursday after being sidelined since Jan. 16 with a shoulder strain.

Текст новости: Tom Thibodeau’s group was massacred Friday night by Kenny Atkinson’s high-octane Cavaliers, who made the Knicks look jayvee in a 142-105 laugher.  “You can’t explain it,” Jalen Brunson said. “I’m at a loss for words really.”  The defeat dropped the Knicks to 0-6 this season against the league’s top three teams — the Cavs, Thunder and Celtics — while casting further doubt on their ability to compete with those teams, let alone beat them, in a playoff series.  The problem was familiar and easy to spot: the defense. Donovan Mitchell, the former Knicks trade target, dissected New York’s soft shell while dropping 27 points in just 26 minutes on 10-of-15 shooting.

Текст новости: Kyle Kuzma’s return to Washington led to a confusing moment with a couple of former teammates. “One time in the first quarter, it might have been Alex [Sarr], he might have blocked a shot. Bilal [Coulibaly] came over to dap him up,” Kuzma said. “Then I dapped up Bilal, just by instinct. It was weird.” Kuzma returned to Washington as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks, and he scored 19 points in their 104-101 victory over Sarr, Coulibaly and the Wizards on Friday night. Kuzma was traded from Washington to Milwaukee earlier this month, with Khris Middleton going to the Wizards in the deal.

Not saying that was a good or a bad thing. I think everything in life really has an expiration date,” Kuzma said. “It was my time to go, beneficial to all parties involved.”

I would like him to be a little more consistent on the on the second and third effort. Sometimes when he done get fouls he’ll melt right there and kind of complain a little bit but I think at least for me when I watch Tatum, he’s learning how to take over games. Obviously he has a a bunch of talent around him so he doesn’t have to do too much but I think him and Jaylen Brown do a great job of being the head of the snake of that team. I love all the pieces that they have up there that has created this green buzzsaw and I think Tatum’s going to get even better. As he gets older he’s going to get smarter, I think his IQ is going to grow, he’s going to get better at playmaking, I see his handles has gotten a light tighter for him to go in and out and be able to go in and get fouls and stuff. I see the growth in his game, the growth in his confidence coming down, being able to put the nail in the coffin, or hit big threes. I see what he’s doing but I’m excited for his growth and what he’s going to be. I don’t think that we’re seeing the best of him yet and I think the best of him is yet to come.’

Текст новости: The apparent audacity of the Mavericks made for good social media fodder. However, while the players the Mavericks blacked out are indeed no longer with the team, none of them is Dončić. WFAA tracked down the original clips that were blacked out and confirmed it was actually Quentin Grimes and Maxi Kleber who got the redacted treatment. Like Dončić, both players were sent away at the trade deadline, Kleber as part of the Dončić deal and Grimes in a trade for Caleb Martin with the Philadelphia 76ers.

Текст новости: However, this is not the case. WFAA, an ABC affiliate in Dallas, took a deep dive into finding the context behind the highlights in the hype video where players were blurred out. None of them were Dončić, although interestingly, the blurred players did include Quentin Grimes and Maxi Kleber, who were both dealt at the deadline. What further disproves this conspiracy is that Dončić is actually shown in the background of a Kyrie Irving highlight unblurred 47 seconds into the video. So clearly, if they were focused solely on blurring out Luka Dončić, they did a pretty poor job of doing so… Maybe the Mavericks video team thought having players blurred out was a cool design that added to the video’s aesthetic. Or perhaps the video strategically blurred out players who were dealt at the deadline.

We have great guys. We communicate very carefully with them about these decisions. … I don’t like a lot of upheaval. I don’t like lineup changes, all that kinda stuff.

Текст новости: The 26-year-old shooting guard was far from the first to hear the news. His expectation was that he’d stick with Lithuanian team Žalgiris Kaunas for the entire season. “It’s funny, everyone found out before me,” Walker said. “I was actually sleeping. I got the phone call from my agent. I had about 30 missed calls. I guess it was all over Twitter already. By that time, my mind was already made as far as being in Europe, finishing the season there. I got a call about two hours before the (NBA buyout) clause ended. So everyone knew before me for sure: ‘You’re coming to Philly!’ and all this stuff.

Текст новости: After his experience in Lithuania, Walker sounded confident in his ability to adapt to anything. “It was honestly one of the more important parts of my young adult life,” he said. “Being so far from home, you have a lot of time of solitude, a lot of time of just looking at yourself in the mirror and holding yourself accountable. I’ve been given an opportunity to look at my flaws, hold myself accountable and understand what I’m trying to grow and become as an individual. “I put myself in a very uncomfortable situation just to become a better man on and off the court. I learned a ton. I grew from it, got better. I think it was very important for me to go through all of that.”

I’m just sitting at this on the courtside like I do and… that sounded douchy. I meant like just standing there doing nothing, I didn’t mean to say… whatever. So all of a sudden Kobe’s giving an interview and then he just starts like going like this, and like I know this is not to me, so I literally like am looking in another direction, because I don’t want to be the guy that like accidentally thinks Kobe’s waving to him, but he keeps walking over and walking over, and he won’t stop. And I’m like ‘Is this motherf*cker talking to me?’ So then he pulls me, he’s like ‘you’, and then he dabs me up in the middle of the Madison Square Garden, I have a video, it’s on my Instagram, and he’s just like talking to me cuz I guess he had just watched an episode of Jersey Shore where I was wearing Kobes, and he had like just dropped them too. That night he invited me to wherever he was eating, we chilled a little bit, and the next day there were 20 pairs of sneakers at my door of the Kobes. It was f*cking epic and he just dropped like 67 points on the Knicks that night. It was crazy, it was pretty legendary.

Текст новости: Josh Hart’s troublesome knee will keep him out of Friday night’s big game.  The Knicks’ Swiss Army knife was ruled out before tip-off against the Cavaliers with what the team described as patellofemoral pain syndrome in his right knee, also known as runner’s knee.  It’s Hart’s second straight DNP coming out of the All-Star break, meaning he hasn’t played in nine days. The forward participated in Tuesday’s practice but not in Wednesday’s session, according to coach Tom Thibodeau.

Текст новости: SI: You’re trying to win a championship. But do you have individual goals? First team All-Defense? Defensive Player of the Year? Lugentz Dort: Honestly, the biggest goal is to go out there and perform every night for my teammates. But it will always be nice to get rewarded for the hard work that I do on the court, which would probably be Defensive Player of the Year or first team. If you ask me if I deserve it, I would say yes, just because of what I bring every night, all the matchups that I got to face every night. But all that would be a goal of mine.

Текст новости: SI: You got to Oklahoma just as they started to rebuild. They traded Russell Westbrook, traded Paul George. What was that first year like? Lugentz Dort: It all started at Summer League for me. That’s when that trade happened, when we brought Shai and then I think that’s when Russ got traded around the same time. And after that for me it was just find a way to get some playing time. I spent most of the early year with the G League. I probably played about 20 games and when some of the guys went down [with injuries], I was the only one that they could call up. So that’s why I got my real chance. And then after a couple of games, I was starting, and then from there, I haven’t seen G League since.

Текст новости: Who’s your GOAT? Keyonte George: This is the guy you grew up watching, thinking he’s the best player of all time. I mean, I grew up watching Russell Westbrook. But I think the GOAT is LeBron. The way he’s been able to play for so long – it’s a huge factor. What he’s doing, he can score the ball, he can pass the ball, he can manipulate the game. So, I think LeBron is the GOAT.

Текст новости: You’ve focused on defense – where do you think you’ve improved, and what’s still your biggest challenge? Keyonte George: I think the biggest challenge for me right now is that I’m matched up with a lot of great guards. So dealing with their strength and speed, staying attached, and continuing to get better at that – just making people take tough shots – is key. But I think my on-ball defense, my ability to chase guys off the ball, and my overall off-ball defense have been major improvements. So I just have to keep staying engaged, understanding what I’m doing well, and recognizing what needs to get better. That’s how I’ll become the complete player I know I will be.

Текст новости: Former NHL player P.K. Subban: ‘If you’re really about it, if you’re really about sports, then you’re about two things: Your teammates and the fans. And I’m sorry, it doesn’t matter how much money you’re making. When you do not show up to play, you’re letting your teammates down. When you do not show up to play you’re letting the fans down that are paying you 40, 50, 60 million. I don’t care if you’re getting 300 million, congratulations, but these people in here are paying $2,500 a ticket, five grand, that are blue-collar, hard-working people. If you don’t get your head wrapped around that you shouldn’t be in pro sports, because how are we going to grow? How do we expect you to be an example? Well guess what, you don’t want to be? you are one. You’re on the biggest stage, you just said it, they make the most money, you’re an example. you got to show up. You gotta take that on. I’m sick and tired of making athletes greats, all-time greats, that are not the best examples. Those are the people that we want our kids, athletes to follow. That helps us in our game. Stephen A. Smith, you want athletes to be educated on this and understand this. They gotta understand the importance of showing up at the All-Star Game, and being on the court, and playing banged-up sometimes, and playing injured maybe at times, and participating. Because here’s the thing: because you’re making 100, 200, 300 million, you should be out there banged up. That’s why we pay you, is to max out. We talk about greatness and the longevity of somebody’s career. I don’t care if you play 50 years. I want your best 10. I want you on the court dominating. I want you to go all-out. I want Michael Jordan, I want Kobe Bryant. That’s what I want on every sport. That’s the guy that I follow. If you’re a different version than that, you don’t have my respect.’

Текст новости: “We chanted ‘Fire Nico,'” Taylor said. “There was nobody booing. Contrary to what Mark Cuban says, nobody was doing any booing during the Mavericks’ free throws. “It was all ‘Fire Nico.'” Bussey and Cuban had a lengthy direct message conversation the following day. Bussey said he told Cuban they were not booing or disrespecting players. He told Cuban he was pushed multiple times by American Airlines Center security during the ejection and hurt his surgically repaired leg. He also said he told Cuban he didn’t plan on pressing charges but wanted to make clear how he was treated by arena security.

Now Luka is out of shape, he’s been having problems with the team internally. Why wasn’t none of this stuff talked about when he was there, as soon as he leave now all of this bad stuff? And that always happening and it’s not fair to the players because we can’t actually come back and write articles and say stuff like the media can so I just feel bad when when stuff like the Luka situation, and even with Jimmy Butler we don’t know the whole situation in totality and what was done behind closed doors. We just know what the player what happened to the player we know what the player was doing or saying and stuff like that and it’s like they want drama, they want to make it look like the player is the worst person in the world, and on top of that he’s getting paid millions of dollars. So now everybody like oh he’s a jerk. That’s not cool, they trying to cover up what they done did by saying the player is bad.

So I’m not going to be upset with that, I’m not going to be upset with them about anything about that. That’s just the way life goes sometimes.”

Текст новости: A source familiar with the Mavericks’ thinking told ESPN the franchise could have done more to prepare for the aftermath of the trade. If they could do it again, the source said, more people should have been involved in the discussion of how to handle the fallout. But it was difficult because Harrison kept the circle so small. The source also said while the Mavericks could have handled the reaction better, the anger surrounding the trade likely would not have changed much. The source acknowledged that at this point, the only way to change the narrative in Dallas is to win — and fast. Overshadowed by the anger, Dallas has won four of seven games since trading Doncic, including four of its last five. And three of the wins have come without Davis, who was injured in the first half of his home Mavericks’ debut on Feb. 8.

Текст новости: On Thursday, he expounded on that optimism while explaining Miami’s need for room to grow as a new big picture comes into focus. “It’s not like we’re going to get everything together. That’s not realistic,” Spoelstra said on Thursday. “We’re going to address the things that need to be addressed. That’s for sure. We have a group that’s going to roll up their sleeves and work on the things that hopefully lead to winning. There’s nothing guaranteed in this league. You can check all these boxes, and it’s still decided between those four lines. The other team has something to say about it. I love the competitive spirit about this team. There’s been a connection even though there’s been a lot things that happened to this team.

Текст новости: “It’s a copycat league,” one executive said. “You see Cleveland playing two bigs and having success, and other teams are going to try to copy that model. “Things have shifted big-time.” We also have seen a depression in offense across the league. Despite all of the noise about 3-pointers, the average offensive rating is down from last season, and several sources pointed to officiating changes enacted around this time last year having an impact.

Текст новости: More recently, however, a very particular application has become the rage — what I call the “Euro stop.” This isn’t just a player slowing down or speeding up on their way to the rim, a la Anderson or Dončić. Instead, the player comes to a dead stop in the middle of the move, often hanging awkwardly with one leg in the air as a defender flies by. Here’s one of the league’s leading practitioners, the San Antonio Spurs’ Harrison Barnes, pulling it off to draw a foul on the Boston Celtics’ Jayson Tatum. Notice how Barnes mixes in a shot fake in the middle of his stops and then comes to a stop at the end, with his right foot staying airborne and left leg planted, before going into his shot.

Текст новости: Barnes spent the 2019 offseason working on his move with then-Kings assistant Noah LaRoche, but it took a while to perfect. Barnes broke it out occasionally but not nearly as often as he has the past two seasons in San Antonio. He was still figuring out how to apply it in live action. “We just worked on that move, just tried to manipulate it, different ways to mix up the variability of the shot,” Barnes said. One of the first times he broke it out in a game, ironically, was against his old coach in 2019-20. “One time in Cleveland I did it on a break, and like three people ran by, and [former Kings coach] Luke Walton was assistant coach at the time and was screaming for a travel,” Barnes said. “I went right by him and said, ‘You’ve seen this move before!’”

Текст новости: Fans were excited to see Wembanyama face off against Kevin Durant on Thursday night in a matchup that never got to happen. After the Spurs defeated the Suns on Thursday, Durant gave some heartfelt words to Wembanyama. “I’m thinking about Vic. I’m sure the whole basketball world is thinking about it, but somebody like that who has a strong mind … he’s going to put his best foot forward,” Durant said. “I don’t even know Vic well enough, but I can just tell.” Durant offered some unexpected advice when it came to what Wembanyama should do during his recovery time. “Go find some more Legos to put together, read some new books and then when it’s time to get back on the court…lock in,” Durant said

Текст новости: But more subtly, Wembanyama also led the league in a different category this season that felt ominous on Thursday: most miles traveled. The San Antonio Spurs criss-crossed the globe this season, flying thousands of miles from Portland to Paris and seemingly everywhere in between. Add up all the travel and you’ll find the Spurs traveled 37,852 miles by the All-Star break, according to Positive Residual schedule analysis. That ranks as the most for any team in the NBA and nearly 80 percent higher than teams like the Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.

Текст новости: But there’s a key difference between Bosh’s career-ending blood clots and Wembanyama’s season-ending blood clot. Bosh’s blood clots were not found to be in his shoulders like Wembanyama. And that might be a silver lining for Wembanyama. I asked Dr. Brian Sutterer, one of the most well-known sports injury doctors, if Wembanyama’s frequent flying may have been a risk factor for his newly discovered condition. Sutterer didn’t see it that way. “I don’t think travel played a role,” Sutterer told me. “The most common location for a deep vein thrombosis is the legs, and it’s often related to the blood pooling from long-term immobilization like air travel or recovery from surgery. If Wembanyama’s was a clot in the leg, absolutely the long travel could be a factor. But in the arm, his anatomy and repetitive motion is the likely cause.”

After Tatum recorded his second triple-double of the season in a 124-104 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, he shared his lofty ambitions.

In Boston, he hopes to take the crown from Bird. “I’m very accomplished at a young age, but the truth is I envision myself as one of those guys: the LeBrons, the Stephs, the KDs,” Tatum said. “I want the next generation to view me as that. Wearing a Celtics uniform comes with a lot of pride, and the best Celtic ever is Larry Bird. Even if I never reach that — maybe I do, maybe I don’t — if you aspire to chase that guy, it comes with a level of focus and motivation every single day to be the best you can.”

You just suddenly start to see that, you know, you both scored 60 points in a game, and you start getting mentioned in (conversations about) the only other Celtics to do this. And then, obviously, once you win a championship, it’s like, all right, you can be in those rooms with the Celtics legends. But it doesn’t just stop at one. You’ve obviously gotta win multiple, and that’s what we’re trying to do. And I always wanted to be the best. He’s, in my opinion, the best Celtic ever. He did it the right way. And he’s a great guy to chase, in a sense.”

Текст новости: Shaquille O’Neal: I was famous for brutalizing David Robinson. People asked, ‘Why don’t you like David Robinson?’ I used to love David Robinson, but I made up in my mind that he didn’t give me an autograph when I was 15. Because the first time I played him, he ran me out of the gym. I was like, ‘Damn, oh, this dude didn’t give me no autograph when I was 15?’ So now, when I see him, I’m gonna kill him on the court.

Текст новости: Erik Slater: Kenny Atkinson gave me a long answer about D’Angelo Russell’s growth as a leader during his first stint with the Nets: “He is a natural leader. He has natural charisma. I used to say with the Nets, he’s got star charisma. He really does. Whatever that DNA is, D’Lo, you can have your opinion about him, but D’Lo thinks he’s a star, know’s he’s a star, and I love that about him. And then, as he started maturing more and getting comfortable here and started playing well, he started to lead me. He’d call me after games. Sometimes I’d call him, but most of the time he would call me [and say], ‘Hey, we should do this. I think we need to make a change in the starting lineup. Man, we’re practicing too much.’ Whatever it is, we had this line of communication. So leadership from that standpoint. And then in the locker room he started gaining a ton of respect in there and started leading in there. I can’t imagine. He must be in the perfect place now, right? He’s kinda seen it all. He’s at that age where I assume he’s the alpha in that locker room. I’m just a big fan of the player, big fan of the leader, big fan of the person.”

Текст новости: Eric Nehm: While the Bucks will miss the contributions of Bobby Portis on the floor, Doc Rivers suggested the team might end up missing his leadership even more. Rivers: It’s funny, what the people don’t see is there’s certain guys that you need. Shootaround was different. Bobby’s the one guy, he’s the voice, you know, ‘Stop ****ing around in practice.” You know, Bobby’s the guy. And he’s the guy that tells everybody that on our team. And, today, it was me saying that and it’s just not the same. Let me tell you, Bobby’s voice is bigger and better. So, those are the ways. Obviously, we miss him on the floor. But I have that saying, ‘You can’t replace a human being.’ You just can’t. And especially one as special as Bobby.

Текст новости: Eric Nehm: I asked Doc Rivers what the communication has been like between him and Bobby Portis today with the suspension being announced and here was his nearly three-minute response: So I just feel bad for Bobby, on so many levels. Dude’s gone through a lot this year with his grandma passing and his house being broken in and then this. The thing I did tell him is this is gonna be one hell of a story for you. Our goals haven’t changed as a team. This one’s gonna be harder. I mean, Bobby is a huge loss. I’m not going to try to sugarcoat that. He’s been so good for us. Not only on the floor, but his spirit, like we need his spirit. But we get to still play. I’ve always been reminded of that. And Bobby does not get to play. So that’s the tough part in this whole thing. And our job is to make sure that – not only just us players and coaches, we gotta make sure Bobby is still with us – but even in the community. He’s so big here. And, people, when you see him out there make sure he knows that you’re with him because he needs it all right now.

Текст новости: I read that your first thought that you could really make the leap to the NBA was when you played Duke and had 11 points, 10 rebounds, four blocks. In terms of your mindset, what changed? Did a switch turn on in your brain? Yves Missi: So that’s actually the first time my parents actually saw me play in person. So they came to that game, and obviously, we had a good game, but we lost the game. But after that, I just felt like if you play one of the best in the country, anything really is possible. If I can compete against this type of player, I probably can try and take a chance to declare for the draft and see what happens. You know, you miss 100 percent of the shots you’re not taking, so just go for it and see what happens.

So just trying to get better at it. Obviously, my rebounding also got better, and my scoring ability. Really just trying to be more versatile and trying to help my teammates. And my defense also got a little better as well.

Текст новости: Mike Curtis: Jason Kidd was asked if the latest update means Anthony Davis has avoided surgery: “I’m not a doctor. That’s in 2 weeks. I think you’ll get a better understanding of what has to take place but right now he’s doing great. He’s in the weight room. He was shooting on the court. A lot of positive things for him. I don’t know if that means surgery, but I think we’re all excited to see him back to work.”

AARON GORDON: I mean, just look at the plus-minus when he’s on the floor versus when he’s off. When he’s on, it’s by far the best team in the league. When he’s off? It’s ugly. You know what I mean? That stat alone tells you everything. We’re fixing that, but at the same time—yo, he got MVP last year, and he’s even better this year. All of his numbers are up. He’s shooting the ball better, averaging a triple-double. His numbers are better than Shai’s. I get that OKC is winning, but come on, bro. He’s doing this while pulling 12 rebounds and 10 assists per game. What are we looking at here? This is one of the most ridiculous stat lines ever.

He’s hilarious. That was something I didn’t expect. You only know about the media stuff from a distance. I was never his teammate before, never really around him in the summer or anything like that. All you hear is what the media puts out—how he is, that he’s a locker room cancer, all that stuff. But when he got here, from day one, he was already making jokes with the guys in the locker room. That’s just his personality. He’s always cracking one-liners, making movie references—he’s just fun to be around. Honestly, he’s a good teammate, and the stuff that was said about him just doesn’t make sense to me at all. He’s also one of the few guys who has fundamentally changed the game.

Текст новости: When asked by FOX Sports if he thinks the Lakers simply had regrets, Mark Williams shrugged. “I think that’s a question for them, not for me,” Williams told FOX Sports. “I was initially excited for the opportunity. I felt like I could have contributed for them. But, obviously, they had second thoughts.” The 23-year-old Williams has only played in 86 games since he was selected by the Hornets as the 15th overall pick in the 2022 draft. A back problem sidelined him for all but 19 games last season, and a strained tendon in his left foot that he suffered in September kept him out this season until Dec. 3.

So, I think noting that, I’ve been healthy and every time I’ve been hurt it’s been stated. And I’ve been 100 percent since.”

Текст новости: LaMelo Ball got to play against the Lakers in the shadows of where he grew up for the first time since 2022, providing well-wishers and others an opportunity to see the Chino Hills native in action in person. And he gave them a treat while also breaking the hearts of Lakers fans, keying the Hornets during crunch time and leading them to a 100-97 victory. “Yeah, just did a great job of playing at a pace that I think we wanted at the end of the game, understanding who he wanted to attack, getting our spacing in a better place,” coach Charles Lee said. “And the part that just shows his leadership and I think his growth is trusting the pass. “There are some opportunities there where he could try to dribble through a double team or make a play himself, but I think he ran whatever play we wanted to run, whatever action, and whatever the game kind of gave him, he made the right play. Super proud of him for continuing to make the plays for himself, but also for his teammates and continue to trust them.”

Текст новости: Chalk that up to the vision of Ball’s father LaVar. Competing against upperclassmen prepped Ball for the mental hurdles he must constantly clear, allowing for a rather swift transition to the NBA once he gained a little more experience. “My pops had me like that, so ever since I was young, I always just played up,” Ball said. ”I do not think I ever played my age for real unless I was a senior. But I was still a young one, so just always played up and just compete.”

Текст новости: ESPN’s Olgun Uluc has revealed Taran Armstrong, Will Magnay and Matt Hurt are the players NBA teams are closely monitoring as the season comes to a close. Speaking on ESPN’s Aussie Hoops Hour podcast, Uluc said those three players are “the hottest names as far as guys who might get 10 days (contracts) or even two ways (contracts) at the end of the season”. Armstrong is coming off a strong campaign with the Cairns Taipans that has seen his NBA stocks soar, with Uluc adding, “I think a lot of us are waiting for next season but there is a real chance that there could be something in the offering towards the end of this NBA season”. While Magnay battled injuries and played just 13 games this season, his immense impact on both ends of the floor has been noticed, with Uluc saying “there is a lot of smoke around, a lot of NBA teams are reaching out about him”. Hurt has had an outstanding campaign, finishing third in MVP voting, making him a prime candidate to return to the NBA.

Текст новости: Ever since Taylor Jenkins took over as Memphis’ head coach, the Grizzlies have been synonymous with floaters. From 2019-20 to today, Memphis has attempted over 1,000 more shots from floater range than the next closest team. This season is no different as the Grizzlies are once again leading the league in shots from the short midrange. A big part of that is Jaren Jackson Jr’s evolution as a scorer. He’s averaging the most points of career by making a living in the space between the restricted area and the foul line. As of this writing, he leads a players in attempts from floater range while converting 52 percent of those shots.

Текст новости: Rick Strom of The Rick Strom Show allowed Antoine Walker to reflect on the harsh words from Ryan that defined his career, pulling back the curtain on what it was like to be on the receiving end of such ruthless commentary. “The simple fact of the matter is that Antoine Walker is a punk,” Ryan wrote. “Antoine Walker is such an arrogant, misguided, yes, punk, that there’s nothing either M.L. Carr, Rick Pitino, or The Pope could do with this kid.” “His juvenile mugging is classless. It irritates opponents – yes, Antoine, people on other clubs really do hate you – and it embarrasses the organization.” “He is a classic product of the modern basketball system. He is an AAU baby who has never worked at anything other than basketball in his life, and who has only met one coach – Rick Pitino – who has ever told him ‘no’ about anything. He is arrogant and clueless about his profession.” “He is merely a punk who can play a little basketball. Join me in wishing him well at his next destination.”

Текст новости: “I confronted him and expressed my displeasure in the article,” Walker recalls. “I asked him and basically told him to keep his comments to strictly basketball. [I told him] that I was not appreciative of some of the language that he used, and he’s taking it to a step that it’s going to get bigger than basketball. “So, we had this conversation, and I basically told him, ‘I’m gonna let you slide, but don’t come around me. You can write what you want to write. If I go 0-for-18, obviously, that’s your job; you’re gonna write it. But, keep any personal attacks of my name out of your mouth. You’re not allowed to have personal attacks of me anymore. If I go 0-for-18, you can write that. If I play bad, do what you need to do. I can’t stop you from that. But, you will never have another personal attack on me either.”

I don’t know what he was writing at that point; I just kind of channeled him out. “But, as long as he didn’t say anything that I felt was taking personal attacks at me, was fine. And if I go 0-for-18, write what you’re supposed to write. I’m not telling you — you gotta do your job, but the personal attacks had to stop.”

Текст новости: New Balance now has seven NBA endorsers — Garland, Zach LaVine, Tyrese Maxey, Dejounte Murray, Jamal Murray, Aaron Nesmith and Kawhi Leonard — forming a curated collective that rotates between four different performance models the brand offers in basketball. The featured silhouettes are Leonard’s signature shoe, the NB Kawhi 4, as well as the Hesi Low v2, TWO WXY v5 and the new Fresh Foam BB v3, which were unveiled in San Francisco during All-Star Weekend with the “A Different Bounce” collaboration designed by South Central Los Angeles-based streetwear brand, Bricks & Wood. “New Balance is a trend-setting brand that players are finally starting to get hip to,” LaVine, the newly acquired Sacramento Kings guard, told Andscape. “We’ve got a pretty good group of NBA guys who I feel could compete against just about any brand.”

Текст новости: Technically, the Los Angeles Lakers rescinded a deal for Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams “due to failure to satisfy a condition of the trade” and determining he didn’t pass his physical. In his first game with the Hornets since the Lakers nixed the trade, however, Williams shared suspicions that the Lakers may have had remorse over dealing rookie guard Dalton Knecht, veteran forward Cam Reddish, a 2031 first-round pick and a 2030 pick swap. “I don’t know for them, if it was what they gave up or went into that reasoning. But I don’t think it was solely because of my physical,” Williams said following the Hornets’ 100-97 win over the Lakers on Wednesday at Crypto.com Arena. “I’ve been playing all year. And I think my minutes and production on the court speak for itself.”

It’s not really something that happens very often,” Williams said. “So I think just the rest of the way being able to show the player that I am, I feel like I’ve been doing that all year and I’ll just try to continue to do that.”

Текст новости: The NBA has suspended Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis for 25 games for violating the league’s anti-drug policy, the league announced Thursday, a ban that sidelines the 2021 champion for the majority of the remainder of the season. Portis tested positive for the drug Tramadol, a medication used to treat severe pain among adults. It is an instance that his representative, Mark Bartelstein of Priority Sports, said was an accident.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: “I am devastated for Bobby right now because he made an honest mistake and the ramifications of it are incredibly significant,” Bartelstein told ESPN. “Bobby unintentionally took a pain medication called Tramadol, thinking he was taking a pain medication called Toradol. Toradol is an approved pain medication that he has used previously and that teams and players use for pain and inflammation at times. Tramadol, however, is not an approved pain medication and was just recently added to the banned substance list this past summer. The Tramadol pill he took came from an assistant of his, with a valid prescription for the painkiller, which he mistakenly told Bobby was Toradol. This was, again, an honest mistake that was made because of the similarity in the names of the drugs and the fact they both serve a very similar purpose. Bobby was using this anti-inflammatory pain-reducing medication to deal with an elbow injury he had this past fall and believed he was taking Toradol to alleviate some pain in preparation for that night’s game.”

Текст новости: It took only three games with LeBron James and Luka Doncic as teammates before the Lakers had to answer the question: Who gets the last shot? Wednesday, it was James. The 22-year veteran missed two potential game-tying 3-pointers in the waning seconds of the Lakers’ 100-97 loss to the Charlotte Hornets. Doncic, who threw the inbounds pass to James with 6.3 seconds left, setting up the first shot, said their roles are interchangeable. “He had it going, so obviously we’re going to go to him,” Doncic said. “I think it will go both ways. One time it’s going to be him, one time me. So I think it depends how the game is going.”

Текст новости: Yet not all 3s are the same. A new approach is adding a subcategory to the deep ball while countering the notion that imagination is dying out in the NBA. The development showed up last weekend in the finals of the 2025 NBA All-Star Game tournament, when Steph Curry drove left around his defender and launched a 3-pointer from the top of the key off one leg like he was shooting a floater in the paint. Swish. It was a classic example of the showmanship for which fans have historically tuned into the All-Star Game—to see the best players in the world try cool plays that they might not in a real game.

Текст новости: This season, however, the one-legged 3 has become a shot that players do use in real games. LeBron James has taken six 3-pointers off of one leg and made four of them. San Antonio Spurs 7-foot-3 phenom Victor Wembanyama has taken seven one-legged 3s, converting on three tries. The shot isn’t just reserved for stars, either—last month, Memphis Grizzlies rookie and second-round draft pick Jaylen Wells hit one over the towering Wembanyama. The one-legged 3 was not invented this season—Curry actually made one in a game all the way back in 2013. Since then, players from Klay Thompson to Pero Antić have used it as a one-off, but not regularly. In the 2019 offseason, former MVP James Harden showcased a new one-legged 3-pointer move in summer workouts and even broke it out in the preseason, but never added it as a staple in his repertoire. The one-legged 3 was purely a heat check shot, such as when Kevin Durant unleashed it against the Atlanta Hawks as part of a 55-point outburst. Now, it’s a reliable offensive weapon for some players. “KD had done it against us a couple years ago and so I saw how it worked for him,” said Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young, who has already taken 15 one-legged 3s this season after attempting just one prior to the All-Star break last season.

Текст новости: “I started taking that shot because I didn’t want to get my shot blocked when I came off a screen,” the 6-foot-1 Young said. “Obviously I’m smaller, but I have the tallest and longest-armed defenders on me every game. A couple guys, guys like Jaden McDaniels, blocked my shot one or two times too much and I was like ‘I’m gonna start this one-legged 3.’” Last season, in a Jan. 12 game against the Indiana Pacers, Young came off a screen dribbling to his left, stopped on two feet and had his shot blocked by 6-foot-1 T.J. McConnell from behind. About 0.75 seconds elapsed between his pickup and his release. In a similar situation on April 12 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Young opted for the one-legged 3, releasing the ball approximately 0.5 seconds after gathering, before the leaping defender could reach it. For a short player often giving up six inches to his opponent, that quarter of a second makes a big difference.

Текст новости: “I started taking that shot because I didn’t want to get my shot blocked when I came off a screen,” the 6-foot-1 Young said. “Obviously I’m smaller, but I have the tallest and longest-armed defenders on me every game. A couple guys, guys like Jaden McDaniels, blocked my shot one or two times too much and I was like ‘I’m gonna start this one-legged 3.’” Last season, in a Jan. 12 game against the Indiana Pacers, Young came off a screen dribbling to his left, stopped on two feet and had his shot blocked by 6-foot-1 T.J. McConnell from behind. About 0.75 seconds elapsed between his pickup and his release. In a similar situation on April 12 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Young opted for the one-legged 3, releasing the ball approximately 0.5 seconds after gathering, before the leaping defender could reach it. For a short player often giving up six inches to his opponent, that quarter of a second makes a big difference.

Текст новости: Luka Dončić is still coming to grips with his blockbuster trade from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. Charania reported Thursday on Get Up his sources have described the five-time All-Star as “shellshocked,” which has “been the vibe around him ever since the trade.” “I think once he gets a rhythm, a routine and gets his legs under him and gets back into basketball shape, I think that’s when we’ll see Luka Dončić perform the way we’re accustomed to,” the NBA insider said.

Текст новости: Jason Richardson: We had a guy on the team my first year in Phoenix, Lou Amundson. He used to ride a bike to practice every day because he lived right across from the arena. Every time he rode his bike, Shaq would take it and hide it. Somewhere in the arena. Every day after practice, Lou was on a scavenger hunt trying to find his bike. This went on for the entire season. Finally, toward the end of the season, Lou had enough. He said, “I’m done with this. Every practice, I spend 45 minutes to an hour trying to find my damn bike.” We tried to warn him. We said, “Yo, Lou, this is Shaq. I’ve heard the stories—doodoo surprise. He used to take a [expletive] in people’s magazines and shoes. This is Shaq you’re dealing with, bro. You might want to chill.”

Текст новости: Jason Richardson: Lou didn’t listen. He said, “Nah, I’m gonna do it.” So, he popcorned Shaq’s van—but not with buttery popcorn, the aluminum kind. Shaq saw it and said, “Oh, okay. This is a good prank, right? You don’t know who the [expletive] you messing with.” Now, fast forward to game day. I walk into the locker room, and Shaq is walking around naked like it’s nothing. But he’s walking real tight, real slow. I’m thinking, “What the [expletive] is going on?”

Текст новости: Jason Richardson: Then he pulls a mouthpiece out of his ass and puts it in Lou’s locker. He looks at us and says, “Y’all better not say [expletive].” Then, he grabs a toothbrush—Lou’s toothbrush—goes into the bathroom, and stirs it in his [expletive]. At this point, we’re like, “Man, we are NOT part of this. This is getting out of hand.” So, the game happens. Somehow, I’m on the bench, Matt Barnes is on the bench, Steve Nash is on the bench, Jared Dudley’s on the bench. Lou is in the game. And Lou puts the mouthpiece in his mouth. The entire bench loses it—EVERYBODY is dying. Lou comes back to the locker room, takes the mouthpiece out, and someone finally tells him, “Hey, Lou, don’t use your mouthpiece. Shaq put it in his ass.” Lou just goes, “Nah, he didn’t.” Then he puts it back in his mouth. The bench loses it AGAIN.

Shaq put your mouthpiece in his ass.” Lou takes it out and just stares at it. Then Matt Barnes tells him, “Bro, anything in your locker room has probably been in Shaq’s ass. Throw it all away.” That’s just Shaq, man. He was a prankster, but he was the nastiest prankster. I swear, if that was me, it would’ve been a fight. Either I would’ve been the most hated person in the league for taking a lead pipe to Shaq’s knee, or I would’ve gotten my ass whooped. But no way I’d let that slide.

He said, “Gilbert, if you don’t bring them donuts, I’m gonna [expletive] you up.” And Chris was serious. So, the next day, Gilbert walks in smiling. He puts the donuts down, walks straight up to my chair, and says, “Hey, J-Rich, don’t eat the donuts. I licked every last one of them.” I said, “What?” He grinned. “I made them extra glazy. I licked every last one.”

I’m thinking, “What’s going on?” A few minutes later, they come back, grab Gilbert, and tape him up like a mummy with athletic wrap. Then, they carry him off the court. In the locker room, we had this big blue laundry cart—about four feet high, used to collect all the dirty uniforms. They filled it up with ice water to the top. And guess what? They dumped Gilbert in there. At first, it was just a prank. But they forgot he was wrapped up. Dude was almost drowning. That’s when everybody started yelling, “Yo, he’s really drowning!” They had to tip the cart over to get him out.

Gil walks out, dripping wet, puts on dry sneakers, and says, “I had to wash that off.” He goes back on the court and drops 29 in the second half. This dude literally washed off a bad game.

Текст новости: Around the time Atlanta’s football team was tracking at midseason for the worst kicking season in at least 33 years, the city’s basketball team was tipping off a new season of its own — and, amazingly, inherited a version of the same curse. As of the All-Star break, the Hawks are currently allowing the NBA’s highest opponent free throw percentage (80.6 percent) and — you guessed it — the league’s worst rate of points above average per game from the charity stripe, with opponents tacking on 0.6 more PPG from free throws than we’d expect from an average team in the same number of attempts. While not quite as historic as the Falcons were, the Hawks’ number is still tracking among the 40 worst seasons since the 1976 ABA merger in terms of opponent PPG added at the free throw line in a single year:

Текст новости: Just like with the Falcons and Mercedes-Benz Stadium, though, there may be something to the idea of teams finding it easier to shoot in Atlanta. This season, the Hawks’ opponents are making 81.6 percent of their FTs in Atlanta, versus 79.9 percent in Hawk road games. State Farm Arena has seen the second-highest road FT% of any NBA venue this season, trailing only the Footprint Center in Phoenix (81.9 percent). That’s nothing new; over the past five seasons, road teams have made 79.3 percent of FTs at State Farm Arena, which ranks third among regular arenas behind only the Golden 1 Center (79.5) and Amalie Arena (79.4).

We had beef in the All-Star Game, bro.” “And so we see each other All-Star Weekend when everything’s supposed to be, ‘We all fans of each other’; Me and Dirk was like, ‘Nah, I don’t f**k with you.’ For some years, that’s how our All-Star Games went. And that’s just how the game was at that time,” he said.

Текст новости: The main holdup right now, per league sources, is the protracted sale of the Celtics franchise, which was put on the market last July by majority owner Wyc Grousbeck. Sources say league officials are eying a sale price of at least $6 billion, in part to set a baseline for the expansion franchise fees (and, of course, in part due to the Celtics being one of the marquee franchises in pro sports). But that hasn’t come to pass yet, and the team remains for sale.

Текст новости: The NBA has forever been a league driven by superstars, by the guys who make us leap off the couch, mouths agape. And by at least one measure, that pool has hardly grown in the past quarter century. “If you look at just the last four years, it’s no different than the preceding 20 years,” says Taylor Snarr, the creator of estimated plus-minus. At The Ringer’s request, Snarr analyzed every season from 2001-02 to the present to assess how many true “superstars” there are in a given year. To do so, Snarr rated players based on EPM, widely considered the gold standard of publicly available, all-in-one impact metrics.

Текст новости: Dwight Howard: I’m mad about that, man, because both of us—we were with Adidas, man. We put on for Adidas. When I lost the deal with Adidas after I left the Lakers—when I played with Kobe and them—they said, “We can’t keep you on Adidas because Lakers fans are mad at you.” Nah, I did not get a new contract, man. That’s crazy. I was with Adidas, I had three Defensive Player of the Year awards, and I never got a big contract. When I did the Superman dunk, they should have gone crazy.

Текст новости: This winter, Cleveland’s hottest commodities are Cavs tickets and a dozen eggs. Thanks to a franchise-best 44-10 start and three NBA All-Star selections, the Cavaliers are on pace to post their highest revenue-generating ticket sales year ever — and that includes the LeBron James era. They also lead the NBA in local TV ratings, rank sixth in overall retail and merchandise sales on NBAStore.com, and have sold out 129 straight games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

Текст новости: The Trail Blazers are investing an undisclosed amount to up their videoboard game at Moda Center ahead of the 2025-26 NBA season. The project, with assistance from ANC and Anthony James Partners, will upgrade the arena’s HustleBoards and StatCentral displays, static boards that were groundbreaking when the venue first opened in the mid-1990s but that haven’t been altered since. More than 7,250 square feet of screen space will replace the old boards, offering more real-time stat and video displays, and in-game entertainment. The system will use LiveSync venue control software from ANC, the project’s tech integrator.

Christian Braun, this last eight-game stretch, is playing just incredible basketball. And so people say, ‘Oh, that’s a tough decision.’ I look at it the opposite way. I’m really fortunate to have a tough decision to make where you have quality players that have really impacted winning. And that’s what it comes down to. It’s never about one player. It’s about what’s best for our team.”

Текст новости: I mentioned before that 2020 featured a lot of fouls — 35 to be exact. Wait, fouls are a good thing? Sure, nobody goes to the arena to see free throws. But they’re a tangible sign of defensive effort. And the 35 fouls were the most in an ASG since 2006. They’ve fallen in every subsequent season, however. There were just 3 personal fouls in last year’s game, for instance. The result? The East won 211-186; a score that looks like a glitch.

Текст новости: Still, given he’s been available save for the team occasionally resting him on either the front or tail end of games on consecutive nights, Mark Williams remains dumbfounded the process got reversed. Less than 48 hours after the trade was officially finalized, Lakers vice president and general manager Rob Pelinka dialed up Williams’ representative and informed him Williams wouldn’t be teaming up with LeBron James and Luka Doncic. Instead, the trade was off, leaving Williams stunned. “My agent told me,” Williams said. “I didn’t think I had failed my physical. That didn’t even cross my mind. The night I got traded I played hella minutes. I didn’t think in any world that was possible. Since I’ve been back since the start of the year, I’ve played games with a lot of minutes. I feel like every injury I’ve had has been well-documented and I’ve recovered and been 100% since. “So, I don’t know what went into that decision. I think that’s up to them.”

Текст новости: Spurned by the Los Angeles Lakers due to a failed physical and returned to the Hornets following the agreed upon Feb. 6 deal for Dalton Knecht, Cam Reddish and draft pick compensation prior to the NBA trade deadline, Williams has been on quite the ride lately. And the emotional roller coaster was enough to leave him a tad queasy. “I mean, it’s crazy,” Williams said. “Your mind has to shift from you got traded, you’ve got to go to L.A. and then you’ve got to shift back from you’re not going to L.A. So, it’s definitely different. “It’s a lot on your mind and you’ve got to take what life gives and make the most of every opportunity you’ve got.”

The Footprint Center, where the Suns and the Mercury play their home games, will have a new name next year as the naming rights contract has been reworked. Player 15 Group, the parent company for the Suns and Mercury, will handle the naming rights negotiations internally and expects to name a new partner before the 2025-2026 NBA season. Footprint, based in Gilbert, Ariz., will remain a team partner but at a lower level of sponsorship. The arena-rights deal began in 2021. The new partner will be the fourth title sponsor for the 18,000-seat, multi-purpose arena that opened in 1992.

Текст новости: YouTube powerhouse MrBeast’s viral stunt in the middle of Sunday’s NBA All-Star Tournament has already earned the league more than 100 million views on its own social channels, in the latest example of online creators shining on sport’s biggest stages. Nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard and Jaren Barajas—a fan chosen from the stands an hour before the game—took turns shooting from near half court at Chase Center. Barajas managed to make one shot before Dame could hit three, earning the local college student $100,000 (while $100,000 was also donated to two charities of Lillard’s choice.) MrBeast and the league formulated the concept over the course of a month, according to NBA SVP for digital and social content Bob Carney.

Текст новости: Below is the football field at Lincoln High, and to the north and east are the lofts and high rises of the Pearl District. As he sits on his balcony he wears a necklace device that delivers electrical impulses to the vagus nerve. The stimulation is designed to help with anxiety, sleep, pain and stress. “It’s for anxiety, but I don’t really have that,” Scoot Henderson said. “But I be thinking a lot. So I put it in my head that the (device) pulls all my thoughts out and lets them go.”

Текст новости: In 27 games since Dec. 21, Henderson is averaging 13.7 points, 5.4 assists and 1.3 steals while shooting 46.8 percent from the field and 41.5 percent from 3-point range. The whispers about him being a bust have quieted. And the urgency for the Blazers to find a point guard to lead their rebuild has eased. Some of Henderson’s emergence is a credit to the Blazers’ player development. John Townsend, a shooting consultant hired by the team, has changed Henderson’s shot. Assistants Chris Fleming and Pooh Jeter have ongoing film sessions with Henderson to show what is a good shot and how to defend better, as well as drills to help him finish better at the rim. Meanwhile, coach Chauncey Billups has held him accountable, threatening during a December meeting to take away his playing time if he didn’t defend better. “It takes a village,” Jeter said.

Текст новости: But above all, Henderson’s uptick in play can be traced to the slowing of his racing mind, and those anxious thoughts being released. Henderson has always had the power, speed and explosion. But since he has been in the NBA, he’s never had this peace of mind. “The thing I’m most proud about is me not thinking,” Henderson said. “I feel like I was thinking I wasn’t thinking, but I was thinking so much to where I was thinking. You can’t hide the fact you were thinking.”

Текст новости: But as autumn turned to winter this season, whispers turned into winds: Was Henderson a bust? “I mean, everybody … I think (bust) came across their mind at some point,” Billups said. “Not me. Not our staff. Because we live with him. We see the inside. We see what’s inside of him.” What made his struggles worse was how badly Henderson wanted to succeed. He worked so hard, cared so much and prepared so thoroughly that he couldn’t understand why it all wasn’t translating to the court.

Текст новости: “That’s the thing, man, people don’t know what I’ve really been thinking about,” Henderson said. “I wanted to be great so fast and I wanted to make an impact so badly … but that can hurt you. It can make you force.” So he started taking refuge on his deck, letting all those bad thoughts, all those anxious desires flow through him and out into the Rose City. He does quick breaths on the deck and finds his center. “I’ve realized, I just need to play,” Henderson said. “Just hoop. Just do this. That’s what I think when I sit and look down on the city: Just hoop. You’ve been doing this your whole life. This is nothing new. Stay confident.”

Текст новости: After starting the season out of the Heat’s rotation, Ware has played double-digit minutes in each of the team’s last 28 games. He has also started in each of the Heat’s last 12 games while being named the NBA’s Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for games played in January along the way. “Nightly he’s getting challenged, and these are all opportunities to grow and learn,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Ware. “He has to do it on the fly. But he’s been a great student. He’s been coachable, not only by the staff but by his teammates. He wants to get it right, he wants to make an impact, he wants to help and he’s facing different challenges.”

Текст новости: “There was just consistent improvement each week, it seemed like every month,” Spoelstra continued on Ware, with the Heat reconvening for its first practice after the All-Star break on Thursday in Miami before resuming its schedule on Friday against the Raptors in Toronto. “And then it got to the point where we needed to find more minutes for him and we weren’t finding enough minutes just having him back up Bam. This is what we talk about all the time. Make us watch you, make us have to play you, make us have to play you more and then I’ll figure it out with the rotation.”

He’s soaking up all the information he can. Obviously, this is still a work in progress. But to me, he’s excelled well.”

As he sits on his balcony he wears a necklace device that delivers electrical impulses to the vagus nerve. The stimulation is designed to help with anxiety, sleep, pain and stress. “It’s for anxiety, but I don’t really have that,” he said. “But I be thinking a lot. So I put it in my head that the (device) pulls all my thoughts out and lets them go.” He started the balcony sessions in December after he received the device as a gift from his mom, and coincidentally, his season and career have taken on a new trajectory.

Текст новости: Boston is taking a significant step closer to a WNBA team, as word came Tuesday that an ownership group led by actor/singer Donnie Wahlberg and former NBA player and Hamilton native Michael Carter-Williams is planning to prepare an offer for an expansion team. Mayor Michelle Wu and Governor Maura Healey also have offered support. The WNBA is in an expansion flurry, with teams in San Francisco (Golden State), Portland, and Toronto beginning play in the next two years. Sports Business Journal reported Cleveland will be the league’s 16th team in 2028.

The Portland franchise paid a $125 million expansion free, while Sports Business Journal reported the Cleveland group paid a record $250 million. “As a longtime Boston Celtics fan who attended countless NBA games in my lifetime, nothing would bring me more joy than to have a WNBA franchise in the city of Boston,” Wahlberg said in an email to the Globe. “I look forward to the day I can walk into the Garden, along with thousands of the greatest (and most knowledgeable) basketball fans on the planet, to root for Boston’s hometown WNBA team.”

And he thought that made a lot of sense too. It’s his choice, but that’s where he wanted to be, and I was blessed enough and able enough to make that happen. In BI’s case, he had a couple of different situations he could have gone into, and Toronto was more aggressive. We were able to get his extension done right then and there, so he doesn’t have to worry about the summer.

What are you thinking as you see what’s taking place this year?” Julius Erving: “Yeah, it’s hard. It’s hard to swallow. We have a Big 3, but they hardly play together. That is the problem right there, so if you’re not playing together you’re probably not practicing together. So we’re really not in the building mode that shows light at the end of the tunnel. Coach is a great guy, and I just kinda feel for him because he doesn’t have what the organization has planned for, you know, guys that can play every night and care about playing every night and figure out a way, if they can’t play, to make a contribution some other way. So with Joel and Tyrese and Paul George, I mean, Tyrese is the most consistent factor there and I love watching him play and the effort that he puts forth and whatever. And if he, even if he’s hurting a little bit, he’s still putting forth the effort. Uh, you know, Joel, he’s looking like playing half the games and maybe going to a third before going to two thirds. And Paul George, great talent. I don’t know, once again, you’re not getting it every night. And I’d like to, I played in the era when guys gave it every night.”

The mural, located at 8251 Melrose Avenue and painted by artist Arutyun Gozukuchikyan, captures a memorable interaction between Doni and icon Kobe Bryant from 2019. It creatively transitions Doncic into Lakers gear, symbolizing his new beginning with the iconic basketball team. Inspired by Doncic’s trade to the Lakers, Gozukuchikyan completed the mural in three days. “Ever since I heard of Luka coming to [the] Lakers, I was itching to do a Lakers mural,” the artist told NBC Los Angeles.

My response is: Colin [Cowherd] told me a long time ago, ‘Don’t punch down. Always punch up.’ So me talking trash to him would technically be punching up. And him, it’s punching down. So I don’t know. I guess pettiness and insecurity aren’t limited to just people who aren’t super successful in their field. I guess that would be my response. “It just doesn’t make any sense.

Текст новости: “It was a lot of ups and downs earlier, but I think everybody is starting to develop respect and understanding for each other,” said Gordon of the Nuggets, who are 22-10 when he plays and 12-4 over his last 16 games. “We have to continue to come together. Play for the next man. Play hard. Everybody has to take care of themselves, but I think we have an opportunity to do something special.”

Текст новости: Gordon’s teammates have played an important role this season, helping him a “ton.” Their caring and trust are genuine. It is a full-circle moment because they are only doing what he has always done. “I understand when you do something of great difficulty, and try and do it for yourself, it just makes it so much harder,” Gordon said. “As opposed to taking that same challenge and that same endeavor, and making your reason about somebody else, and doing it for somebody else. It just becomes a lot easier.”

Текст новости: Had he remained in Dallas, Dončić would have been eligible to sign a five-year, $345 million contract. The estimation from the outside, one that The Athletic confirmed once the trade was completed, was that he wanted to re-up with the organization for the long term in July. Dončić said as much when he arrived for his introduction in Los Angeles. But there was one twist: The Mavericks were never going to offer Dončić that mega-deal, league sources said. And a general manager identifying one star to trade, negotiating with only one GM he knows and trusts and targeting only one player who he’s worked with before and whose character he can vouch for — just as Harrison did with Dončić, Pelinka and Davis — was no accident.

He also is a great fit next to Doncic as the two played together with the Dallas Mavericks and developed a close friendship. But even if the Doncic trade never happened, joining the Lakers is still a dream come true for Finney-Smith as he revealed in a Lakers’ digital interview that the purple and gold was his favorite team growing up in Virginia: “It means a lot to put on a Lakers jersey because the Lakers was my favorite team. Being from Virginia, liking the Lakers was a little rough because you either loved the Lakers or you hate them. I’m happy I get to live out my dream.”

Текст новости: Following the Lakers’ 108-95 victory in which Doncic had a subpar performance, missing all six of his three-point shots while scoring 19 points, Bryant greeted the budding superstar by saying, “My Man! What’s up brother?” Doncic replied, “I was like, ‘Who is talking Slovenian?’” They shared a laugh, another handshake and a hug. Doncic posed for a photo with Gianna, then for another with Bryant. A month later, Bryant and Gianna were among the nine people who died in a helicopter crash in the hills above Calabasas on Jan. 26, 2020. Doncic now is a member of the Lakers after a trade that redefined the meaning of surprising. And to no one’s surprise, a mural that captures that 2019 meeting of Bryant and Doncic already is complete.

So are the grins Bryant and Doncic wore during their short meeting. The mural was painted by Arutyun Gozukuchikyan, known as ArToon. The Armenian artist’s first mural of Bryant was painted a week after his death, on the side of an exotic car rental company along Ventura Boulevard. Bryant and Gianna, then 13, are smiling and looking skyward.

The 21,000-square-foot property located at 24258 N 91st St. in Scottsdale, AZ, was listed on Zillow last month with an asking price of $23.5 million. Aside from the notable amenities like five bedrooms, a full-sized basketball court, and a movie theater, this property also includes a $300K “Jordan Room” designed to display 290 pairs of Air Jordans and holds up to 325 pairs of sneakers total. The Zillow listing also says that over 60 NBA players, including Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, and others, have visited this home since it was built in 2017, as it was previously owned by Attitude is Free founder Brett Hardt Sr.

Текст новости: Early in the first episode, there’s a short clip of Haliburton and Embiid chopping it up on the sideline. Haliburton asked Embiid if he would want to join the Pacers and the 76ers’ big man said he would prefer to retire. “I might want to come to Indy,” Embiid said. “Psych! Never in my life. I would rather retire.”

Текст новости: Is a return likely? Steve Lichtenstein writes that it’s simply not practical at least under current circumstances. “But is that in Brooklyn’s interest? Russell will have an approximately $28 million cap hold this offseason, which might be useful if Marks has another sign-and-trade up his sleeve for the summer. Otherwise, it’s hard to envision that the Nets would bring him back (I’m not sure a Russell/Cam Thomas backcourt will jive with Head Coach Jordi Fernandez’s defensive mandates), in which case that cap hold is an obstacle to their vision for the near future.”

Текст новости: Lichtenstein even suggests that buying out Russell before March 1 so he could join a contender might be a “clarifying statement” for fans wondering if the tank lives. That seems highly unlikely but the Nets are still shuffling things around at the bottom of the roster as Thursday’s game approaches. As Lewis reports that the Nets won’t be able to suit up Tyrese Martin in Brooklyn colors Thursday unless he signs a standard deal before then. In short, his two-way deal requires it. All that, Russell seems happy with the Nets and the Nets seem happy with Russell. Both sides seem to accept that it is what it is.

Текст новости: Why can’t everyone learn from McClung, right? Because life is about preparation. Insanely, Grant Hill asked McClung: “Do you go out and practice these dunks before you do ’em, or do you do ’em for the first time when you’re out here?” In a string of interviews following his victory, McClung detailed his process, which sounded like Fisher’s. He had been targeting this night in February, McClung said, for “eight or nine months.” He found gyms that would open their doors wide to a car. Can you imagine spending an hour in some practice gym with a dunk coach failing to jump over a car? McClung went through all that, and learned. He had been furiously sharing videos of different concepts, grilling his friends about which was a “guaranteed 50.” McClung said his buddy, Nate, who served up a ball from a rotating hoverboard, had been practicing five hours a day for two weeks. That’s something like 70 hours of hovering.

Текст новости: Basketball is an American sport, and because of that, Stephen A. Smith doesn’t think that Victor Wembanyama can be the face of the league even if he is the best player in the NBA. “My personal opinion is I don’t believe an international player can be the face of the NBA,” Smith said on Tuesday. “I know they’re global, iconic figures, their popularity extends globally, but the NBA is an American born sport, and it needs to resonate in America, and if it doesn’t resonate in America, then it’s not going to matter to America, how you resonate beyond and so that’s just my mentality. That’s how I think about it, not to say they can’t be popular but I just think about it that way.”

But I wouldn’t be mad. I just think they need to factor in how much a perimeter defender really runs around. Because if they did that, I don’t think they would need to have two different awards. I think perimeter players would get more awards because guarding the best perimeter player is a very tiring task. Actually, you know what? Now that I’ve said all that, I actually do like the idea. If perimeter players aren’t going to get the award anyway, they might as well do this.

Текст новости: There might be no line anymore, actually, with eligible players sometimes entering the draft just to try to generate greater riches from the transfer portal. The line has also blurred to near erasure for the increasing number of NBA people who leave the pro game for the NCAA ranks. The ever-complicated dynamics of building and managing a roster full of paid players has been steadily attracting folks from the NBA to the college. And it’s going to keep happening. “People around the league are [constantly] talking about this,” one NBA team executive told me recently. “There is power and salary to be had.”

Текст новости: Adam Aaronson: But with Embiid, the ceiling is so much higher. For that reason, despite his contract being “worse” on paper and George being a far safer bet to actually play consistently, it is actually slightly easier for me to imagine Embiid generating genuine interest in the trade market. I would unquestionably bet against it; this sort of financial tie to a player with such serious injury concerns is likely a nonstarter for the vast majority of NBA franchises. To circle back to your original question: I do not think the Sixers will trade Embiid or George this summer, in part because there is no evidence which compels me to believe teams would have interest in acquiring either one.

So as much as he says I showed him all this stuff—and yeah, he ate all my food, which I’m going to keep bringing up—you probably owe me close to about $250,000 in food. But I’m going to let that keep compounding with interest till it gets close to a mil, then I’m going to ask for it. But what he did for me, from a spiritual standpoint, was bringing me to the Lord. Even though my dad is an ordained minister, AC was the one who really helped me understand how having God in my life was going to help me—not just in basketball, but personally, in business, and in everything else. Yeah, I appreciate you, Junior.

Текст новости: Someone not surprised by the lack of expansion buzz in San Francisco was a former Sonics player who has been among the most vocal about getting the NBA’s return to Seattle. Gary Payton is not concerned. “I don’t worry about that. We don’t need to worry about that,” Payton said Sunday after signing autographs at the NBA’s fan festival, including several of his Sonics jerseys. “We don’t need to worry about buzz and all that stuff as long as Adam Silver makes a decision on what is going on we’ll be fine.”

So too has former SuperSonic and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Spencer Haywood. Following the announcement of this year’s Hall of Fame finalists on Friday, the mention of expansion couldn’t fully be asked before Haywood interjected. “Two years,” he said.

Текст новости: Kenny Atkinson, currently the head coach in Cleveland, spent a significant amount of his coaching career in Europe before rising through the NBA ranks. He’s a dreamer and joked about the idea of coaching long enough to see teams in European cities. But should it take the place of looking at expanding domestically? “That’s hard for me. I don’t know the economics of it. That’s a decision to make,” Atkinson said. “I’m more of a romantic. I know how great FIBA basketball and international basketball (is). I’d just love one day to go play an NBA team in Madrid or an NBA team in Paris. I know how passionate the fans are. I think it would take the NBA to another level.”

Текст новости: After wrapping up a long weekend of activities throughout the Bay Area with the All-Star Game on Sunday at Chase Center, Lacob spoke exclusively to NBC Sports Bay Area’s Bonta Hill after the game, where she shared his thoughts on the festivities, specifically in San Francisco. “Everything just came out so great,” Joe Lacob told Hill. “By the way, I want to say this: San Francisco is back, OK? Let’s just make it very very clear, it is back. The city looked great this weekend. People delivered, there were parties all over the city. I had people talk to me constantly [about] how much they enjoyed the city and they were surprised. Well they shouldn’t be surprised. It’s back, and that’s a great thing.”

Текст новости: It might be surprising to hear where Derek Fisher is now: high school. The Laker great just wrapped up his second season as the head coach of the Crespi High boys basketball team in Encino. After coaching previously in both the NBA and WNBA, Fisher was plotting his next move when his son and two stepsons began playing for Crespi in 2023. When Crespi’s coach left, the school approached Fisher. He wasn’t interested because his kids were on the team. “I’ve seen how the father-coach relationship can hurt the father-son relationship,” Fisher told KTLA’s Steve Hartman. But after some thought, he took the gig.

Yet he still reached the pinnacle of NBA success by outworking the competition. He’s now trying to instill that same drive into his Crespi High players. “These are kids who are not ranked as the Top 100 recruits in the nation, and neither was I,” he says. “But if you can help someone access their highest levels of potential, maybe see something in themselves they haven’t seen yet, they might look at me and say if that guy who was born in Little Rock, played in Little Rock, can go on to do all the things he’s done, then why can’t I?”

Текст новости: Truth be told, it took me a moment to figure out how to respond to what, at first glance, sounded like delusion. After all, the Vegas oddsmakers currently have 10 teams above the Warriors in their title-team odds (Golden State is a +5000 on BetMGM). So I asked, somewhat delicately, if his prediction was intended to be applied to this current season. The Warriors are 28-27 overall, tied with the Sacramento Kings for ninth in the Western Conference, and miles behind teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the defending champion Boston Celtics, all of whom have proved to be quite formidable. “Yes,” he replied. “Absolutely.”

Текст новости: The NBA All-Star Game has come and gone, with another milestone marking the end of Turner Sports’ 40-year domestic partnership with the league. Its new format, with a four-team tournament, had some positives in the sense that player effort was clearly elevated over the last several years—a low bar to clear, to be sure—but it was marred by endless play stoppages for commercials, Kevin Hart, and Mr. Beast. At one point, Hart eulogized an Inside the NBA that is very much not dead, but rather migrating to ESPN next season while still being produced by TNT. Sources who were in the Bay Area this weekend—in hotel lobbies and at cocktail parties and sponsorship events—say several changes for the weekend are being discussed for next year even before Sunday’s game tipped off.

Haralabous Voulgaris (former Mavs executive): I wanted to buy an NBA team, but then I saw how the sausage was made, and I thought, Yeah, the NBA is not for me. Why Not? For one, franchise valuations keep going up and up. It’s a very difficult business to buy into because you’re competing with the richest people in the world for these assets. And then, honestly, I just stopped finding the sport as interesting. The bubble kind of ended it for me. During that time, the NBA became more about a social cause than just basketball. And look, that’s cool if you believe in that—it’s good for society in some ways. But for me, it just became too much. I just wanted sports.

Текст новости: DeMarcus Cousins on the Pelicans: Well, I can say from my experience, we were always the stepkid to the New Orleans Saints. It’s an ownership group that owns both. But New Orleans is real cool. They’re very prideful about their Saints. I’ve experienced that, I’ve seen that growing up in that region. So, I know how much love they have for their Saints. And being a young organization, and you’re trying to compete with a team like the Saints, it’s hard for the public to do. I think they’re always the team like a stepkid.

Текст новости: If such a U.S. vs. The World All-Star matchup had the traditional 12-man rosters, four more players from the world pool would be needed — and that would mean four fewer American players would get the All-Star nod. “The USA has more talented players than the rest of the world,” said Nikola Jokic, the three-time MVP from Serbia who led Denver to the NBA title in 2023. “Europe and the rest of the world has talented players, I think, but the majority of the players are coming from USA.”

Текст новости: Victor Wembanyama has already gone up against the U.S. in international events, most notably last year’s Paris Olympics when he led France’s march to the gold medal game against the Americans. He’d like to be in that position more often — maybe even annually. And Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo loves that idea as well. In the ongoing search for the right NBA All-Star format, there was plenty of talk this weekend in San Francisco about an idea that has picked up some momentum in recent years: The U.S. on one side, the world on the other side. Count Wembanyama — San Antonio’s 7-foot-4 All-Star center from France — as a fan of that notion. “I would love to. My opinion is that it’s more purposeful,” Wembanyama said. “There’s more pride in it. More stakes.”

Текст новости: Hours before playing in the NBA All-Star Game, Stephen Curry’s voice cracked during the NBA Legends Brunch on Sunday morning when he took the podium to “honor the memories of those we lost this year.” Amidst giving posthumous honor to the likes of Al Attles, Bill Walton and Jerry West, the Golden State Warriors superstar paid respect to Dikembe Mutombo, who died Sept. 30, 2024. “Dikembe was an eight-time All-Star and a four-time Defensive Player of the Year,” Curry said. “Dikembe’s trademark finger wag after blocking a shot was the exact opposite of his selfless and welcoming nature off the court. Dikembe was a true global ambassador and humanitarian.”

Текст новости: NBA commissioner Adam Silver unveiled the NBA Africa Dikembe Mutombo Humanitarian Award on Feb. 15 at the 10th annual NBA Africa All-Star Luncheon. The NBA described the award as “a new annual honor that will recognize a person or an organization that works to advance health, education or economic opportunity across the continent of Africa.” Following his retirement from the league in 2009, Mutombo, a native of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was the NBA’s first global ambassador, as appointed by late NBA commissioner David Stern.

He was so committed to it. “His spirit was infectious. Part of it was just being a 7-footer. We all knew when we traveled with him, whether it was to Mumbai — a place where people might not know much about basketball or Dikembe Mutombo — I think because of his size, because of his laugh, just because of his presence, they instantly would know he was somebody important and he’d create those connections, something we all talk about so much these days.”

Dončić filled a thermos with lemonade and sweet tea. “I know liquid calories are death,” Voulgaris told then-owner Cuban. Voulgaris, according to his recounting, was told to stay in his lane. (In a response to those comments, Cuban told The Athletic, “Bob has always talked a good game.”)

Текст новости: Those who have observed the rise of the 52-year-old Nike executive-turned-NBA team builder say Harrison is disciplined and fitness-focused; that he is even-keeled and not easily swayed by emotion; and that he is so tight-lipped, only those on a need-to-know basis are kept informed of the facts. Even as the public has learned some of why the Mavs made this Dončić trade — from Harrison’s frustrations with Dončić’s conditioning and off-court habits, his yearning for a better defender and his tight relationship with incoming star Anthony Davis — the decision remains nonetheless viewed by much of the public as irrational and impulsive.

Текст новости: There was another person of note he persuaded to hop on board, too: Dončić, a Nike athlete when Harrison helped managed it. Eventually, the Slovenian guard moved to Jordan Brand, which Nike owns, with Harrison again playing a role in that decision. At Nike, the Seals had their own secret handshake. It includes at least two or three daps. The Athletic is not privy to the intricacy of the greeting, given the true confidentiality of how Seals, even ones at an athletic apparel brand, slither behind the scenes. “(Harrison) maintained the position of secrecy a lot,” a source who worked with him at Nike said. “He wouldn’t really tell you his plan until he needed you to be a part of his plan.”

Can I trust him?” the exec said. “And Nico has always been very honest. He’s a very upfront person, a straight-shooter.”

It’s more up and down, and the pace is up higher than it’s ever been. The style of play, I think, is just wearing on guys’ bodies. The break is so deep into the season. We’ve only got less than 30 games left. So our bodies are constantly breaking down over the course of a long season. At this point, you’re coming to the break, you’re like, we’re trying to get to the playoffs healthy, you know? “I don’t think it’s a matter of guys not caring. It’s just so much pressure on ‘this guy didn’t win (a championship),’ and they need to do this and do that. So we want to be our best for that.

I take my pregame nap. I get my treatment the night before. I don’t go out. I have my pregame meal. I treat it like a game, because I want to give my A-game against the best players in the world. Some other players — don’t get me wrong — you can go about your day, your routine, any way you want. Some people just want to get out of here.”

Текст новости: The WNBA is preparing to award Cleveland its 16th franchise, multiple sources have told SBJ, with an approximate bid worth a league record $250M. The sources put Cleveland’s expansion chances as high as 90% —with an announcement expected no later than March —and said the WNBA has re-thought its original plan of adding just one team and could award one or two more franchises to bring its league total to 18 clubs. The presumed leaders for the second and third teams are Philadelphia, Houston, Nashville, Detroit and Miami, with the league reiterating tonight that nothing is finalized.

Some adored Oracle, now Oakland Arena, because it was theirs, they felt the love and they knew it was genuine. “It’s pretty dope,” said Stephen Curry, whom the crowd showered with rich cheers upon his return to the room where he and the Warriors routinely destroyed visitors.

Текст новости: Curry enjoyed reliving the good times during an All-Star Weekend practice at Oracle before the HBCU Classic game featuring Morehouse College and Tuskegee University. “This is a moment for sure,” Curry said. “I think the idea of knowing we made the move to Chase Center and been in San Francisco the last six seasons, to have a little bit of a moment to honor and reminisce the 47 years that we played in this building, the 10 years that I had growing up in the game inside these walls, the energy in this building that can come back just like that. I’ve enjoyed it to the fullest.”

It’s really something that I think was a really strong emotion. But otherwise, I think the Mavs are still contenders. The Lakers are contenders. It’s very competitive. They traded for very good players. It’s interesting. We’ll see how it goes. But in two weeks after, it’s still the craziest trade I’ve ever seen.”

Текст новости: Boston is currently on the hook for $513 million in combined salary and tax penalties for next season alone. Paying that type of bill would be record breaking for any owner in the NBA history so needless to say, there’s some skepticism across the league that the Celtics new boss will come in willing to foot that bill. Just how much the Celtics will need to trim is the bigger question.

Текст новости: The WNBA is preparing to award Cleveland its 16th franchise, multiple sources have told SBJ, with an approximate bid worth a league record $250M. The sources put Cleveland’s expansion chances as high as 90% —with an announcement expected no later than March —and said the WNBA has re-thought its original plan of adding just one team and could award one or two more franchises to bring its league total to 18 clubs. The presumed leaders for the second and third teams are Philadelphia, Houston, Nashville, Detroit and Miami.

But in the two decades since, the league’s exponential growth and popularity has led to rising expansion fees. The Golden State Valkyries, the league’s 13th franchise launching in May, paid $50M to join the WNBA, while Toronto and Portland —the 14th and 15th franchises —paid $115M and $125M, respectively. Now that has doubled.

Текст новости: Jaylen Brown asked the group gathered at Oakstop, a community organization not far from where the Celtics star attended college at California-Berkeley, to excuse him. He felt under the weather and warned his voice would sound monotone. The attendees at the event, some chatting through earlier speakers including the mayor, locked in when he stepped to the podium. Discussing gentrification, abandoned buildings, incarceration rates and how business development could combat those woes in Oakland and other cities, Brown introduced a new business district plan above 19th Street Station at the heart of the city that hopes to inspire locals to build and sustain wealth locally. “The bad news is it’s gonna take a lot of work, but the good news is we’re ready to fight,” Brown said in his brief speech. “It’s a different world, it’s a different generation…the world is changing through technology and innovation … before it took expertise, resources and a lot of excess motivation to start a business. In today’s time, through the use of technology, it’s much more accessible and practical to start a business.”

Текст новости: The announcement of the facility came as the next step in Brown’s roughly year-old Xchange program that started between Boston and Oakland, receiving support locally in either city from Jrue Holiday and Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd. While he aims to expand to other cities, the program ties to his college and professional homes as his fourth all-star berth brought him back to his short yet impactful stay in the Bay Area. Brown fondly remembers the connection he built around Oakland, an internship with a venture capital firm and many have told the story of the graduate level classes he attended at Cal. While rarely able to visit the area anymore, his alignment with local leaders allowed for a partnership.

Текст новости: Local businessman Shawn Granberry, who hosted Friday’s event at Oakstop, connected Brown and Trevor Parham, an Oakland activist who founded Oakstop in the spirit of what Xchange became roughly one decade before Brown’s idea. They merged the two to form the Oakland leg of Xchange and have worked together since to form the business district that will serve as an incubator for development. Brown stressed utilizing A.I. to streamline processes, make business formation more accessible and formulate marketing strategies. “Our building at 1721 Broadway has three levels,” Parham said. “On those three levels, we have a mix of spaces that are used to for training and events, and they also have office spaces and open co-working spaces, and what we plan to do is we also plan to renovate that building with a whole bunch of new offices that can serve that incubator function. So the overall idea is that you have a building that simultaneously houses nonprofits that can provide education and learning to organizations and individuals, but then you also have office spaces that can house those folks that are building those businesses.”

Текст новости: One of Kidoń’s first true loves was breakdancing. Through that, he’s crafted a lane as one of the most unique Globetrotters — which says something considering the team’s longstanding history of merging basketball with entertainment. “When I started creating my own tricks, I noticed I could do everything with a basketball,” Kidoń said. “I could stand and do some tricks, but I could also move my body, like, do a cartwheel or stand on my head or control a basketball between my legs. So, I just started to explore, not even just basketball, but dance, hip-hop, breakdancing. “I was looking for some elements I could combine with basketball. That’s how I started, basically. I started doing breakdancing because there are elements of breakdancing that are possible to connect with basketball.”

Текст новости: For Kidoń, joining the Globetrotters meant more than adjusting to a new passion. He was getting acclimated to a new team, a new language, a new culture and demographic of people. Kidoń is the first person from his family to fly to the United States, let alone learn to build a life so far from home. He still remembers his first day with the Globetrotters, which included media duties with newspapers, TV networks and radio stations excited to meet him. That made waves back in Poland because the Globetrotters don’t allow just anybody to try out for their roster. Once he was officially a member, Kidoń went from being nicknamed “KID” to his current moniker. And “Dazzle” has been dazzling. “If I could hear somebody bouncing the ball, I knew it was Dazzle,” Dunbar said. “He’s out there working every day, and he’s competing with these guys, playing one-on-one every day. He’s trying to get to their level.”

Текст новости: In merging all of the adjustments into one life-changing transition, what has been most key to Kidoń going from a freestyling entertainer to a full-time basketball player? For the Polish star, preparation is beyond essential. “I try to practice all the time because I know I’ve got a lot of work to do,” he said. “I’m not as good in basketball as other players yet. Basically, I wake up, I eat breakfast, and almost every single day, I start my day with stretching and some movements. Then usually, we’ve got to travel, like three, four hours to the next city. “Before every single game, I’m trying to be prepared. I practice my tricks, like, my old tricks to keep my shape. Also, I’ll take some shots to be a better shooter. We play some two-on-two games, three-on-three games. I’m focused on improving my basketball skills, my basketball IQ. … When you see me in the arena all the time, you can see me all the time with the basketball in my hands.”

Beyond the team-issued statement in the aftermath of the Lakers pulling the plug, the Hornets have been mum publicly. We don’t know precisely how Jeff Peterson feels about what’s transpired. The Hornets’ president of basketball operations has yet to address the media and there is no definitive word when that will happen.

Текст новости: After the Miami Heat’s pre-All-Star break schedule came to an end in Dallas on Thursday night, Heat guard Tyler Herro flew back with the team to Miami. That might seem like an unusual move for a player who needs to be in San Francisco this weekend to take part in Saturday night’s Three-Point Contest and play in his first NBA All-Star Game on Sunday night. But Herro wanted to return to Miami to pick up his family and friends, so they could all take a Friday morning flight together to the West Coast for All-Star Weekend. It’s part of Herro’s plan to share as much of his first true NBA All-Star experience as possible with those closest to him. “Just spending it with my family, getting a break,” Herro said when asked what he’s looking forward to the most from All-Star Weekend. “Just seeing all my people there and being able to experience it with them.”

But [expletive] can change if I’m not doing my job and doing what I’m capable of, and staying healthy. At the end of the day, it’s good for now.

But then it’s cool to see that they believed in him, like this is why we got you because we think you can be an All-Star. I didn’t forget that as a parent and Tyler didn’t forget that.”

Текст новости: At a YMCA basketball game during the mid-2000s in Texas, Cade Cunningham stood between the top of the key and the elbow with a smirk on his face. Cunningham, draped in a blue jersey with the No. 23, was only about 5 years old, but he was the main attraction during a dead-ball situation. His right shoelace came undone, and for safety precautions, a referee decided to tie Cunningham’s laces during the stoppage. “I was having my way back then,” Cunningham told The Detroit News, with a smile. “I was just trying to learn the game. That’s like the beginning stages, trying to fall in love with the sport. I was just having fun.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: At 5, he had no clue how to tie his shoelaces. However, it was the moment Cunningham’s family noticed that his advanced basketball skills elevated him above the other kids in his age group. At the time, he distinguished himself from his peers as one of a small group of kids who knew how to dribble up the court with one hand. Nearly two decades later, Cunningham, in his fourth year as a pro, is distinguishing himself as a first-time NBA All-Star, selected by NBA coaches to represent the Detroit Pistons at the league’s midseason showcase on Sunday. “It’s awe-inspiring,” Cade’s older brother, Cannen, told The News. “I’m happy for him because he’s doing the right things; he wants to be great, and there’s no other option. It’s cool to observe that and see what happens if you put your mind to it and see it come to reality.”

Текст новости: Dave McMenamin: Highlights from Dalton Knecht’s media availability at the All-Star Rising Stars practice: Dalton Knecht on the rescinded trade with Charlotte: “It’s strange. I’m one of the few people that’s ever been traded and then come back, so it’s been a crazy journey. I’m just glad to be back and be a part of the team. I get to learn from Luka now. I had AD, Bron and now I’m with Luka and Bron. So, it’s crazy. I get to learn from a lot of greats”

Текст новости: Dave McMenamin: Dalton Knecht on the best advice he’s received in the NBA: “D-Lo, he gave me the best advice. Right after a game, just move on. Don’t care about how you did. Just move on because you got the next game coming towards you. No matter how high or how low that game was, you got to move on and be ready to play the next one and get better.”

Текст новости: Welts and the Mavericks’ business staff leapt into crisis management mode as shock boiled into anger, with fans phoning and emailing to vent and in some cases cancel season tickets. “I thought I’d seen everything in my 47 years in the NBA, but clearly this was different,” Welts said. “I think a lot of people of good intent tried to do the right thing. “I probably underestimated the reaction. I think we’ve done the best we can, basically, with the staff and trying to do the right thing with everybody who touches the Mavericks.

Текст новости: Dumont declined to specify when Welts learned Dallas was trading its superstar, but he says Welts “took it in stride. He immediately realized we needed to spend time working with our fans and that we needed to explain what we were doing. “He’s been showing great leadership, working with our internal team to make sure they understand what happened because it was a big surprise to them. Luka grew up in this organization; there was an emotional connection to him and we have to respect that.”

Текст новости: Welts told The Dallas Morning News much of his first year as CEO will be spent addressing the Mavericks’ arena needs, though he and Dumont stress the franchise intends to fulfill its American Airlines Center lease, which expires in July 2031. “This will look nothing like Chase Center; it will look nothing like the Intuit Dome,” Welts said. “This will hopefully be the greatest expression of what Maverick fans would expect when they walk into the arena to see a Mavericks game. “It will have everything about Texas and Dallas that we can bring to it, to give it a shape and form that will be a foundation for economic competition over the next 30 or 40 years.”

Текст новости: Raymond Felton on his stint in Portland: ’It was a rough year for me man because it was a lot of bad stuff that was said about my weight, coming in out of shape, and I dealt with that, the scrutiny of that, and then man listen, my momma had a real bad situation where she had to have heart surgery. I had to miss like six games and there was a dude, that’s why to this day I try not to pay attention to comments on social media, I try not to pay attention to things that people say, but this dude was like ‘man I hope and wish your momma die’. When I saw that I just lost it and I think that was just the last straw in Portland. I just went on a rant on TV, and I was just like ‘any of you motherf*ckers want to come see me, this my address’. I gave my address and everything. Listen, not my momma. Don’t play with my momma. For somebody to say he wish that she die, that just did something to me in my head. I told the dude ‘if I ever see you’, because I had his face and everything, I told him ‘If I ever see you, it’s on sight. And I just said a whole bunch of other stuff that I don’t need to right now’.

Текст новости: Jalen Brunson isn’t ruling out a return to the 3-point competition after losing in his second try. The Knicks guard didn’t get past the first round Saturday after rushing through his final rack as time was running low. He finished with 18 points, and Miami’s Tyler Herro emerged as a first-time champion by beating Golden State’s Buddy Hield in the final. “Started off hot. I felt great. And then. Oops,” Brunson said. “I feel like I rushed the last rack. You could practice all you want, but once you get out there it’s a tad different.”

Текст новости: Brunson, who is shooting 40 percent this season from beyond the arc, was trying to become the first Knick and first lefty to win the competition. He might try again. “Maybe. I don’t know,” said Brunson, who joined Trent Tucker as the only Knicks to compete in two 3-point contests. “I’ll leave that door open.”

Текст новости: He may still not be a household name, nor is he really an NBA player, but Mac McClung can now say he is the most accomplished dunk champion in league history. The greatest? Maybe. “That’s definitely not for me to say,” McClung said from his familiar spot, up on the dais next to a trophy. “The biggest thing is, I genuinely love this contest.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Текст новости: “I was extremely honored to be a part of this weekend,” McClung said. “I genuinely love this contest and [I’m] just very appreciative.” McClung’s opening-round dunk generated a score of 50, and he posted four jams worth 50 points to become one of four players with at least four such dunks in a single dunk contest. The other three are Zach LaVine (2016), Aaron Gordon (2020) and Derrick Jones Jr. (2020), according to ESPN Research.

Текст новости: The Chase Center crowd was with McClung, the reigning G League MVP for the Osceola Magic. And if someone else steps up with impressive dunks, they will woo the crowd, too. “When you feel like the crowd has your back, that gives you a different level of adrenaline, maybe confidence,” McClung said. “It was great, it felt really good. And the judges gave me some good scores, so that got me feeling good. I really do like to play off the crowd.”

Текст новости: Before it was over, NBA star and explosive dunker Ja Morant posted to social media that McClung’s performance may have convinced Morant to step forward next year. Morant tweeted, “mac might make me decide to dunk.” Giannis Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP, said if Morant dunks, he’ll dunk. “If you do it. I’ll do it with you,” Antetokounmpo said in response to the Memphis star. Morant called out Aaron Gordon and Zach LaVine, two great dunk contest competitors, to join next year.

Текст новости: Despite the eye-popping tone-setter, McClung found himself in a hotly contested final showdown with San Antonio rookie guard Stephon Castle, who logged a score of 99.6 in the last round and narrowly finished second. Castle is just the fourth Spur to compete in the event, and the first since 1988 (Greg Anderson). “I felt like my third dunk should have been a 50,” Castle said. “We could’ve [gone] to a dunk-off. I don’t know if that’s what the crowd would’ve wanted. But overall, I was happy with it.”

Текст новости: He also likes being teammates with Brunson, who Towns has deferred to as the Captain since arriving from that stunning trade. “I didn’t come over to be a distraction or disrupt the flow or be on an ego trip or anything. It’s about the team. And I came to amplify them and amplify Cap’,” Towns said. “You can’t win a championship by yourself. You need everybody. And I’m just happy we have a team full of guys who are willing to sacrifice and look at the big picture and do what it takes to bring the city wins every single night, and hopefully it results in a chip.”
